The SFENCE (Store Fence) instruction controls write ordering by creating a fence<br />
for memory store operations. This instruction guarantees that the result of<br />
every store instruction that precedes the store fence in program order is<br />
globally visible before any store instruction that follows the fence. The SFENCE<br />
instruction provides an efficient way of ensuring ordering between procedures<br />
that produce weakly-ordered data and procedures that consume that data.<br />
