Org-mode is a powerful system for organizing your complex life with
simple plain-text files. It seamlessly integrates all your notes,
mindmaps, TODO lists, calendar, day planner, and project schedules into
a single system that can be easily searched (e.g. by grep), encrypted
(e.g. by GnuPG), backed up and synced (e.g. by Dropbox), imported/exported,
and accessed on the go (e.g. on an iPhone or Android smartphone). It can
even be used for authoring web pages and documents.

say about Org-mode, and read a few user stories!

<p>
Org-mode is distributed as part of the popular Emacs text editor and runs
wherever Emacs runs, including on GNU-Linux, Windows, and Mac. Written by
Carsten Dominik, it is currently maintained by Bastien Guerry and used by
many helpful people who, like you, are desperate to get and stay organized.

<p>
The page you're reading is part of Worg, a section of the Org-mode web site
that is written by a volunteer community of Org-mode fans. It includes
tutorials, ideas, code snippets, etc., shared to make your introduction and
customization of Org-mode as easy as possible. Worg is maintained by
Matthew Lundin, a group of Worg contributors, and maybe you.
