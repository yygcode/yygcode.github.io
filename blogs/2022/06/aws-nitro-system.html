</p>

<p>
At Tuesday Night Live with James Hamilton at the 2016 AWS re:Invent conference,
I introduced the first Amazon Web Services custom silicon. The ASIC I showed
formed the foundational core of our second generation custom network interface
controllers and, even back in 2016, there was at least one of these ASICs going
into every new server in the AWS fleet. This work has continued for many years
now and this part and subsequent generations form the hardware basis of the AWS
Nitro System.  The Nitro system is used to deliver these features for AWS Elastic
Compute Cluster (EC2) instance types:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High speed networking with hardware offload</li>
<li>High speed EBS storage with hardware offload</li>
<li>NVMe local storage</li>
<li>Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) for MPI and Libfabric</li>
<li>Hardware protection/firmware verification for bare metal instances</li>
<li>All business logic needed to control EC2 instances</li>
</ul>

<p>
We continue to consume millions of the Nitro ASICs every year so, even though
it's only used by AWS, it's actually a fairly high volume server component.
This and follow-on technology has been supporting much of the innovation
going on in EC2 but haven't had a chance to get into much detail on how
Nitro actually works.
</p>

<p>
At re:Invent 2018 Anthony Liguori, one of the lead engineers on the AWS Nitro
System project gave what was, at least for me, one of the best talks at
re:Invent outside of the keynotes. It's worth watching the video (URL below)
but I’ll cover some of what Anthony went through in his talk here.
</p>

<p>
The Nitro System powers all EC2 Instance types over the last couple of years.
There are three major components:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nitro Card I/O Acceleration</li>
<li>Nitro Security Chip</li>
<li>Nitro Hypervisor</li>
</ul>

<p>
Different EC2 server instance types include different Nitro System features and
some server types have many Nitro System cards that implement the five main
features of the AWS Nitro System:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nitro Card for VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</li>
<li>Nitro Card for EBS (Elastic Block Store)</li>
<li>Nitro Card for Instance Storage</li>
<li>Nitro Card Controller</li>
<li>Nitro Security Chip</li>
</ul>

<p>
These features formed the backbone for Anthony Liguori's 2018 re:Invent talk and
he went through some of the characteristics of each.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org75873bf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org75873bf"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Nitro Card for VPC</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
The Nitro card for VPC is essentially a PCIe attached Network Interface Card
(NIC) often called a network adapter or, in some parts of the industry, a
network controller. This is the card that implements the hardware interface
between EC2 servers and the network connection or connections implemented on
that server type. And, like all NICs, interfacing with it requires that there
be a specific device driver loaded to support communicating with the network
adapter.  In the case of AWS NICs, the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) is the
device driver support for our NICs. This driver is now included in all major
operating systems and distributions.
</p>

<p>
The Nitro Card for VPC supports network packet encapsulation/decapsulation,
implements EC2 security groups, enforces limits, and is responsible for
routing. Having these features implemented off of the server hardware rather
than in the hypervisor allows customers to fully use the underlying server
hardware without impacting network performance, impacting other users, and
we don't have to have some server cores unavailable to customers to handle
networking tasks. And, it also allows secure networking support without
requiring server resources to be reserved for AWS use. The largest instance
types get access to all server cores.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't covered in the talk but the Nitro Card for VPC also supports a number
of network acceleration features. The Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) uses the
Nitro Card network acceleration features to provide user space networking
capabilities similar to those found on many supercomputers. Customers wishing to
take advantage of EFA can use the OpenFabrics Alliance Libfabric package or use
a higher level programming interface like the popular Message Passing Interface
(MPI) or NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL).  Whether using
Libfabric, MPI, or NCCL, applications bypass the operating system when talking
to EFA, and are able to achieve more consistent performance with lower CPU
utilization.  MPI and NCCL are commonly used package in science, engineering,
and machine learning applications and, to a lesser extent, distributed
databases.

<div id="outline-container-org91a8fdf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org91a8fdf"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Nitro Card for EBS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The Nitro Card for EBS supports storage acceleration for EBS.  All instance
local storage is implemented as NVMe devices and the Nitro Card for EBS
supports transparent encryption, limits to protect the performance
characteristics of the system for other users, drive monitoring to monitor
SSD wear, and it also supports bare metal instance types.
</p>

<p>
Remote storage is again implemented as NVMe devices but this time as NVMe over
Fabrics supporting access to EBS volumes again with encryption and again without
impacting other EC2 users and with security even in a bare metal environment.
</p>

<p>
The Nitro card for EBS was first launched in the EC2 C4 instance family.

<h2 id="orga77dc7e"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Nitro Card for Instance Storage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The Nitro Card for Instance storage also implements NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory
for PCIe) for local EC2 instance storage.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcc0ccd8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcc0ccd8"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Nitro Card Controller</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The Nitro Card Controller coordinates all other Nitro cards, the server
hypervisor, and the Nitro Security Chip. It implements the hardware root of
trust using the Nitro Security Chip and supports instance monitoring functions.
It also implements the NVMe controller functionality for one or more Nitro Cards
for EBS.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org261a978" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org261a978"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Nitro Security Chip</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The Nitro security chip traps all I/O to non-volatile storage including BIOS and
all I/O device firmware and any other controller firmware on the server. This is
a simple approach to security where the general purpose processor is simply
unable to change any firmware or device configuration. Rather than accept the
error prone and complex task of ensuring access is approved and correct, no
access is allowed. EC2 servers can't update their firmware. This is GREAT from a
security perspective but the obvious question is how is the firmware updated.
It's updated using by AWS and AWS only through the Nitro System.
</p>

<p>
The Nitro Security Chip also implements the hardware root of trust. This system
replaces 10s of millions of lines of code that for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface">Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface (UEFI)</a> and supports secure boot. In starts the server up
untrusted, then measures every firmware system on the server to ensure that none
have been modified or changed in any unauthorized way. Each checksum (device
measure) is checked against the verified correct checksum stored in the Nitro
Security Chip.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org358e9d1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org358e9d1"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
The Nitro System supports key network, server, security, firmware patching, and
monitoring functions freeing up the entire underlying server for customer use.
This allows EC2 instances to have access to all cores – none need to be reserved
for storage or network I/O. This both gives more resources over to our largest
instance types for customer use – we don't need to reserve resource for
housekeeping, monitoring, security, network I/O, or storage. The Nitro System
also makes possible the use of a very simple, light weight hypervisor that is
just about always quiescent and it allows us to securely support bare metal
instance types.
