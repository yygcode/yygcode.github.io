<p>
We’re getting a lot of queries lately around how exactly VAAI behaves at the
lower level. One assumes more and more VMware customers are seeing the benefit
of offloading certain storage intensive tasks to the array. Recently the
questions I have been getting are even more in-depth. I’ve been back over my
VAAI notes gathered since 4.1, and have put together the following article.
Hope you find it useful.
</p>

<p>
VAAI first appeared in vSphere 4.1, and was only available to block storage
devices (iSCSI, FC, FCoE). This was enhanced in 5.0 to include support for NAS
device primitives and also introduced an UNMAP primitive for reclaiming stranded
space on a thin provisioned VMFS.
</p>

<p>
A closer look at the original primitives and a description on how they work
follows. I've used various references to some of the primitives as they seem to
have taken on numerous different names since first launched.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5669d2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5669d2b"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Atomic Test &amp; Set (ATS)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
This is a replacement lock mechanism for SCSI reservations on VMFS volumes when
doing metadata updates. Basically ATS locks can be considered as a mechanism to
modify a disk sector, which when successful, allow an ESXi host to do a metadata
update on a VMFS. This includes allocating space to a VMDK during provisioning,
as certain characteristics would need to be updated in the metadata to reflect
the new size of the file. Interestingly enough, in the initial VAAI release, the
ATS primitives had to be implemented differently on each storage array, so you
had a different ATS opcode depending on the vendor. ATS is now a standard T10
and uses opcode 0x89 (COMPARE AND WRITE).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8bf9c67" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8bf9c67"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Write Same/Zero</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
One of the most common operations on virtual disks is initializing large extents
of the disk with zeroes to isolate virtual machines and promote security.
vSphere hosts can be configured to enable the WRITE SAME SCSI command to zero
out large portions of a disk. With WRITE SAME enabled, VMware ESX/ESXi will
issue the command to arrays during specific operations. This offload task will
zero large numbers of disk blocks without transferring the data over the
transport link. The WRITE SAME opcode is 0x93.
</p>

<p>
The following provisioning tasks are accelerated by the use of the WRITE SAME
command:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cloning operations for eagerzeroedthick target disks.</li>
<li>Allocating new file blocks for thin provisioned virtual disks.</li>
<li>Initializing previous unwritten file blocks for zerothick virtual disks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The data out buffer of the WRITE SAME command will contain all 0's. A single
zero operation has a default zeroing size of 1MB. When monitoring VAAI counters,
it is possible that you will only observe the WRITE_SAME incrementing in batches
of 16 in esxtop. This is because we only ever launch 16 parallel worker threads
for VAAI, so don’t be surprised if you only see a batch increments of 16 Write
Same commands during a zero operation.
</p>

<p>
Note: Not all storage arrays need to do this directly to the disk. Some arrays
only need do a metadata update to write a page of all zeroes. There is no need
to actually write zeroes to every location, speeding up this process
dramatically all round.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdfd2bc2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgdfd2bc2"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Full Copy/XCOPY/Extended Copy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
This primitive is used when a clone or migrate operation (such as a Storage
vMotion) is initiated from a vSphere host, and we want the array to handle the
operation on our behalf. vSphere hosts can be configured to enable the EXTENDED
COPY SCSI command. When examining VAAI status in esxtop, you may see this
counter increment in batches of 8 because the default size of a Full Copy
transfer is 4MB. With a 32MB I/O size, this gave batches of 8 for a full XCOPY
I/O. The opcode for XCOPY is 0x83.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What VAAI offloads looks like from an I/O perspective?</li>
</ul>

<p>
I've had a number of requests to describe exactly what happens under the covers
when some of these offload operations are taking place. The default XCOPY size
is 4MB. With a 32MB I/O, one would expect to see this counter in esxtop
incrementing in batches of 8. The default XCOPY size can be incremented to a
maximum value of 16MB.
</p>

<p>
The default WRITE SAME size is 1MB. With a 32MB I/O, one would expect to see
this counter in esxtop incrementing in batches of 16, since we only ever launch
16 parallel worker threads for VAAI. We currently do not support changing the
WRITE SAME size of 1MB.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Differences between VAAI in 4.x &amp; VAAI in 5.x</li>
</ul>

<p>
One final piece of information I wanted to share with you is a distinction
between our first phase/release of VAAI in vSphere 4.1 and our second phase of
VAAI which was released with vSphere 5.0. A list of differences appears below.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>VAAI now uses standard T10 primitives rather than bespoke array commands</li>
<li>Full ATS with VMFS-5. Here is a link to a blog post which talks about
locking inmore detail.</li>
<li>Support for NAS Primitives – An overview of the vSphere 5.0 primitives can
be found here.</li>
<li>VCAI (View Composer Array Integration) – Read how View is using VAAI to
offloads clones to the array here</li>
<li>UNMAP support – Some additional information on the new UNMAP primitive can
be found here.</li>
<li>VMware HCL now requires performance of primitives before an array receives
VAAI certification. This is important as certain storage arrays which appear
in the vSphere 4.1 HCL may not appear in the vSphere 5.0 HCL if the
performance of the offload primitives do not meet our requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
My thanks to Ilia Sokolinski for clarifying some of the behaviours above.
