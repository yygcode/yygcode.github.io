MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing
and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a
key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce
function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same
intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown
in the paper.

Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and
executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes
care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program’s
execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the
required inter-machine communication. This allows programmers without any
experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources
of a large distributed system.

Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines
and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes
of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use:
hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand
MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clusters every day.

Over the past five years, the authors and many others at Google have implemented
hundreds of special-purpose computations that process large amounts of raw data,
such as crawled documents, web request logs, etc., to compute various kinds of
derived data, such as inverted indices, various representations of the graph
structure of web documents, summaries of the number of pages crawled per host,
the set of most frequent queries in a given day, etc. Most such computations are
conceptually straightforward. However, the input data is usually large and the
computations have to be distributed across hundreds or thousands of machines
in order to finish in a reasonable amount of time. The issues of how to
parallelize the computation, distribute the data, and handle failures conspire
to obscure the original simple computation with large amounts of complex code to
deal with these issues.

As a reaction to this complexity, we designed a new
abstraction that allows us to express the simple computa-
tions we were trying to perform but hides the messy de-
tails of parallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution
and load balancing in a library. Our abstraction is in-
spired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp
and many other functional languages. We realized that
most of our computations involved applying a map op-
eration to each logical “record” in our input in order to
compute a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and then
applying a reduce operation to all the values that shared
the same key, in order to combine the derived data ap-
propriately. Our use of a functional model with user-
specified map and reduce operations allows us to paral-
lelize large computations easily and to use re-execution
as the primary mechanism for fault tolerance.
The major contributions of this work are a simple and
powerful interface that enables automatic parallelization
and distribution of large-scale computations, combined
with an implementation of this interface that achieves
high performance on large clusters of commodity PCs.
Section 2 describes the basic programming model and
gives several examples. Section 3 describes an imple-
mentation of the MapReduce interface tailored towards
our cluster-based computing environment. Section 4 de-
scribes several refinements of the programming model
that we have found useful. Section 5 has performance
measurements of our implementation for a variety of
tasks. Section 6 explores the use of MapReduce within
Google including our experiences in using it as the basis

for a rewrite of our production indexing system. Sec-
tion 7 discusses related and future work.
2 Programming Model
The computation takes a set of input key/value pairs, and
produces a set of output key/value pairs. The user of
the MapReduce library expresses the computation as two
functions: Map and Reduce.
Map, written by the user, takes an input pair and pro-
duces a set of intermediate key/value pairs. The MapRe-
duce library groups together all intermediate values asso-
ciated with the same intermediate key I and passes them
to the Reduce function.
The Reduce function, also written by the user, accepts
an intermediate key I and a set of values for that key. It
merges together these values to form a possibly smaller
set of values. Typically just zero or one output value is
produced per Reduce invocation. The intermediate val-
ues are supplied to the user’s reduce function via an iter-
ator. This allows us to handle lists of values that are too
large to fit in memory.
2.1 Example
Consider the problem of counting the number of oc-
currences of each word in a large collection of docu-
ments. The user would write code similar to the follow-
ing pseudo-code:
map(String key, String value):
<i>/ key: document name
/</i> value: document contents
for each word w in value:
EmitIntermediate(w, "1");
reduce(String key, Iterator values):
<i>/ key: a word
/</i> values: a list of counts
int result = 0;
for each v in values:
result += ParseInt(v);
Emit(AsString(result));
The map function emits each word plus an associated
count of occurrences (just ‘1’ in this simple example).
The reduce function sums together all counts emitted
for a particular word.
In addition, the user writes code to fill in a mapreduce
specification object with the names of the input and out-
put files, and optional tuning parameters. The user then
invokes the MapReduce function, passing it the specifi-
cation object. The user’s code is linked together with the
MapReduce library (implemented in C++). Appendix A
contains the full program text for this example.
2.2 Types
Even though the previous pseudo-codeis written in terms
of string inputs and outputs, conceptually the map and
reduce functions supplied by the user have associated
types:
map (k1,v1) → list(k2,v2)
reduce (k2,list(v2)) → list(v2)
I.e., the input keys and values are drawn from a different
domain than the output keys and values. Furthermore,
the intermediate keys and values are from the same do-
main as the output keys and values.
Our C++ implementation passes strings to and from
the user-defined functions and leaves it to the user code
to convert between strings and appropriate types.
2.3 More Examples
Here are a few simple examples of interesting programs
that can be easily expressed as MapReduce computa-
tions.
Distributed Grep: The map function emits a line if it
matches a supplied pattern. The reduce function is an
identity function that just copies the supplied intermedi-
ate data to the output.
Count of URL Access Frequency: The map func-
tion processes logs of web page requests and outputs
hURL, 1i. The reduce function adds together all values
for the same URL and emits a hURL, total counti
pair.
Reverse Web-Link Graph: The map function outputs
htarget, sourcei pairs for each link to a target
URL found in a page named source. The reduce
function concatenates the list of all source URLs as-
sociated with a given target URL and emits the pair:
htarget, list(source)i
Term-Vector per Host: A term vector summarizes the
most important words that occur in a document or a set
of documents as a list of hword, frequencyi pairs. The
map function emits a hhostname, term vectori
pair for each input document (where the hostname is
extracted from the URL of the document). The re-
duce function is passed all per-document term vectors
for a given host. It adds these term vectors together,
throwing away infrequent terms, and then emits a final
hhostname, term vectori pair.
