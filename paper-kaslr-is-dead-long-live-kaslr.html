<p>
Modern operating system kernels employ address space layout randomization (ASLR)
to prevent control-flow hijacking(劫持) attacks and code-injection attacks.
While kernel security relies fundamentally on preventing access to address
information, recent attacks have shown that the hardware directly leaks this
information. Strictly splitting kernel space and user space has recently been
proposed(被提议的) as a theoretical concept to close these side channels.
However, this is not trivially possible due to architectural restrictions of the
x86 platform.
</p>

<p>
In this paper we present KAISER, a system that overcomes limitations of x86 and
provides practical kernel address isolation. We implemented our proof-of-concept
on top of the Linux kernel, closing all hardware side channels on kernel address
information. KAISER enforces a strict kernel and user space isolation such that
the hardware does not hold any information about kernel addresses while running
in user mode. We show that KAISER protects against double page fault attacks,
prefetch side-channel attacks, and TSX-based side-channel attacks. Finally, we
demonstrate that KAISER has a runtime overhead of only 0:28%.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Like user programs, kernel code contains software bugs which can be exploited
to undermine([ʌndə'maɪn], vt. 破坏) the system security. Modern operating
systems use hardware features to make the exploitation([eksplɒɪ'teɪʃ(ə)n], 利用)
of kernel bugs more difficult. These protection mechanisms include making code
non-writable and data non-executable. Moreover, accesses from kernel space to
user space require additional indirection and cannot be performed through user
space pointers directly anymore (SMAP/SMEP). However, kernel bugs can be
exploited within the kernel boundaries. To make these attacks harder, address
space layout randomization (ASLR) can be used to make some kernel addresses or
even all kernel addresses unpredictable for an attacker. Consequently, powerful
attacks relying on the knowledge of virtual addresses, such as
return-oriented-programming (ROP) attacks, become infeasible [14,17,19]. It is
crucial for kernel ASLR to withhold any address information from user space
programs. In order to eliminate address information leakage, the
virtual-to-physical address information has been made unavailable to user
programs [13].

Knowledge of virtual or physical address information can be exploited to
bypass KASLR [7, 22], bypass SMEP and SMAP [11], perform side-channel attacks
[6,15,18], Rowhammer attacks [5,12,20], and to attack system memory encryption
[2]. To prevent attacks, system interfaces leaking the virtual-to-physical
mapping have recently been fixed [13]. However, hardware side channels might
not easily be fixed without changing the hardware. Specifically side-channel
attacks targeting the page translation caches provide information about virtual
and physical addresses to the user space. Hund et al. [7] described an attack
exploiting double page faults, Gruss et al. [6] described an attack exploiting
software prefetch instructions,1 and Jang et al. [10] described an attack
exploiting Intel TSX (hardware transactional memory). These attacks show that
current KASLR implementations have fatal flaws, subsequently KASLR has been
proclaimed dead by many researchers [3, 6, 10].
</p>

<p>
Gruss et al. [6] and Jang et al. [10] proposed to unmap the kernel address
space in the user space and vice versa. However, this is non-trivial on modern
x86 hardware. First, modifying page table structures on context switches is not
possible due to the highly parallelized nature of today's multi-core systems,
e.g., simply unmapping the kernel would inhibit parallel execution of multiple
system calls. Second, x86 requires several locations to be valid for both user
space and kernel space during context switches, which are hard to identify in
large operating systems. Third, switching or modifying address spaces incurs
translation lookaside buffer (TLB) flushes [8]. Jang et al. [10] suspected that
switching address spaces may have a severe performance impact, making it
impractical(不切实际的).
</p>

<p>
In this paper, we present KAISER, a highly-efficient practical system for kernel
address isolation, implemented on top of a regular Ubuntu Linux. KAISER uses a
shadow address space paging structure to separate kernel space and user space.
The lower half of the shadow address space is synchronized between both paging
structures. Thus, multiple threads work in parallel on the two address spaces if
they are in user space or kernel space respectively. KAISER eliminates the usage
of global bits in order to avoid explicit TLB flushes upon context switches.
Furthermore, it exploits optimizations in current hardware that allow switching
address spaces without performing a full TLB flush. Hence, the performance
impact of KAISER is only 0:28%.
</p>

<p>
KAISER reduces the number of overlapping pages between user and kernel address
space to the absolute minimum required to run on modern x86 systems. We evaluate
all microarchitectural side-channel attacks on kernel address information that
are applicable to recent Intel architectures. We show that KAISER successfully
eliminates the leakage in all cases.

<p>
Virtual addressing is the foundation of memory isolation between different
processes as well as processes and the kernel. Virtual addresses are translated
to physical addresses through a multi-level translation table stored in physical
memory. A CPU register holds the physical address of the active top-level
translation table. Upon a context switch, the register is updated to the
physical address of the top-level translation table of the next process.
Consequently, processes cannot access all physical memory but only the memory
that is mapped to virtual addresses. Furthermore, the translation tables entries
define properties of the corresponding virtual memory region, e.g., read-only,
user-accessible, non-executable.
</p>

<p>
On modern Intel x86-64 processors, the top-level translation table is the page
map level 4 (PML4). Its physical address is stored in the CR3 register of the
CPU. The PML4 divides the 48-bit virtual address space into 512 PML4 entries,
each covering a memory region of 512 GB. Each subsequent level sub-divides one
block of the upper layer into 512 smaller regions until 4 kB pages are mapped
using page tables (PTs) on the last level. The CPU has multiple levels of caches
for address translation table entries, the so-called TLBs. They speed up address
translation and privilege checks. The kernel address space is typically a
defined region in the virtual address space, e.g., the upper half of the address
space.
</p>

<p>
Similar translation tables exist on modern ARM (Cortex-A) processors too, with
small differences in size and property bits. One significant difference to
x86-64 is that ARM CPUs have two registers to store physical addresses of
translation tables (TTBR0 and TTBR1). Typically, one is used to map the user
address space (lower half) whereas the other is used to map the kernel address
space (upper half). Gruss et al. [6] speculated that this might be one of the
reasons why the attack does not work on ARM processors. As x86-64 has only one
translation-table register (CR3), it is used for both user and kernel address
space. Consequently, to perform privilege checks upon a memory access, the
actual page translation tables have to be checked.
</p>

<p>
<b>Control-Flow Attacks</b>. Modern Intel processors protect against code injection
attacks through non-executable bits. Furthermore, code execution and data
accesses on user space memory are prevented in kernel mode by the CPU features
supervisor-mode access prevention (SMAP) and supervisor-mode execution
prevention (SMEP). However, it is still possible to exploit bugs by redirecting
the code execution to existing code. Solar Designer [23] showed that a non-
executable stack in user programs can be circumvented([sɜːkəm'vent], 绕行) by
jumping to existing functions within libc. Kemerlis et al. [11] presented the
ret2dir attack which redirects a hijacked control flow in the kernel to
arbitrary locations using the kernel physical direct mapping. Return-oriented
programming (ROP) [21] is a generalization of such attacks. In ROP attacks,
multiple code fragments &#x2013; so-called gadgets &#x2013; are chained together to build an
exploit. Gadgets are not entire functions, but typically consist of one or more
useful instructions followed by a return instruction.
</p>

<p>
To mitigate(['mɪtɪgeɪt]，减轻，缓和) control-flow-hijacking attacks, modern
operating systems randomize the virtual address space. Address space layout
randomization (ASLR) ensures that every process has a new randomized virtual
address space, preventing an attacker from knowing or guessing addresses.
Similarly, the kernel has a randomized virtual address space every time it is
booted. As Kernel ASLR makes addresses unpredictable, it protects against ROP
attacks.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Caches are small memory buffers inside the CPU, storing frequently used data.
Modern Intel CPUs have multiple levels of set-associative caches. The last-level
cache (LLC) is shared among all cores. Executing code or accessing data on one
core has immediate consequences for all other cores.
Address translation tables are stored in physical memory. They are cached
in regular data caches [8] but also in special caches such as the translation
lookaside buffers. Figure 1 illustrates how the address translation caches are
used for address resolution.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
Until recently, Linux provided information on virtual and physical addresses
to any unprivileged user program through operating system interfaces. As this
information facilitates mounting microarchitectural attacks, the interfaces are
now restricted [13]. However, due to the way the processor works, side channels
through address translation caches [4, 6, 7, 10] and the branch-target buffer[3]
leak parts of this information.
</p>

<p>
Address Translation Caches. Hund et al. [7] described a double page fault
attack, where an unprivileged attacker tries to access an inaccessible kernel
memory location, triggering a page fault. After the page fault interrupt is
handled by the operating system, the control is handed back to an error handler
in the user program. The attacker measures the execution time of the page fault
interrupt. If the memory location is valid, regardless of whether it is
accessible or not, address translation table entries are copied into the
corresponding address translation caches. The attacker then tries to access the
same inaccessible memory location again. If the memory location is valid, the
address translation is already cached and the page fault interrupt will take
less time. Thus, the attacker learns whether a memory location is valid or not,
even if it is not accessible from the user space.
