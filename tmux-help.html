NAME
     tmux &#8212; terminal multiplexer

SYNOPSIS
     tmux [-2CluvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name] [-S socket-path]
          [command [flags]]

DESCRIPTION
     tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created,
     accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be detached from a screen
     and continue running in the background, then later reattached.

     When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it
     on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the cur&#8208;
     rent session and is used to enter interactive commands.

     A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux.
     Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the entire
     screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo
     terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the technical details of pseudo termi&#8208;
     nals).  Any number of tmux instances may connect to the same session, and any number
     of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, tmux
     exits.

     Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1)
     connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the &#8216;C-b d&#8217; key strokes).  tmux
     may be reattached using:

           $ tmux attach

     In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed
     by a single server.  The server and each client are separate processes which commu&#8208;
     nicate through a socket in /tmp.

     The options are as follows:

     -2            Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.

     -C            Start in control mode (see the CONTROL MODE section).  Given twice
                   (-CC) disables echo.

     -c shell-command
                   Execute shell-command using the default shell.  If necessary, the tmux
                   server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.  This
                   option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login
                   shell.

     -f file       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, tmux loads the
                   system configuration file from /etc/tmux.conf, if present, then looks
                   for a user configuration file at ~/.tmux.conf.

                   The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are executed in
                   sequence when the server is first started.  tmux loads configuration
                   files once when the server process has started.  The source-file com&#8208;
                   mand may be used to load a file later.

                   tmux shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in
                   the first session created, and continues to process the rest of the
                   configuration file.

     -L socket-name
                   tmux stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp
                   if it is unset.  The default socket is named default.  This option
                   allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several inde&#8208;
                   pendent tmux servers to be run.  Unlike -S a full path is not neces&#8208;
                   sary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.

                   If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent
                   to the tmux server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if
                   any parent directories are missing).

     -l            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for
                   compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.

     -S socket-path
                   Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If -S is speci&#8208;
                   fied, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is
                   ignored.

     -u            When starting, tmux looks for the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environ&#8208;
                   ment variables: if the first found contains &#8216;UTF-8&#8217;, then the terminal
                   is assumed to support UTF-8.  This is not always correct: the -u flag
                   explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.

                   Note that tmux itself always accepts UTF-8; this controls whether it
                   will send UTF-8 characters to the terminal it is running (if not, they
                   are replaced by &#8216;_&#8217;).

     -v            Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into
                   tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current
                   directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process.  If
                   -v is specified twice, an additional tmux-out-PID.log file is gener&#8208;
                   ated with a copy of everything tmux writes to the terminal.

                   The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to toggle
                   logging between on (as if -v was given) and off.

     -V            Report the tmux version.

     command [flags]
                   This specifies one of a set of commands used to control tmux, as
                   described in the following sections.  If no commands are specified,
                   the new-session command is assumed.

KEY BINDINGS
     tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a pre&#8208;
     fix key, &#8216;C-b&#8217; (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.

     The default command key bindings are:

           C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
           C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
           C-z         Suspend the tmux client.
           !           Break the current pane out of the window.
           "           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
           #           List all paste buffers.
           $           Rename the current session.
           %           Split the current pane into two, left and right.
           &amp;           Kill the current window.
           '           Prompt for a window index to select.
           (           Switch the attached client to the previous session.
           )           Switch the attached client to the next session.
           ,           Rename the current window.
           -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
           .           Prompt for an index to move the current window.
           0 to 9      Select windows 0 to 9.
           :           Enter the tmux command prompt.
           ;           Move to the previously active pane.
           =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.

     Key bindings may be changed with the bind-key and unbind-key commands.

COMMANDS
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by tmux.  Most commands
     accept the optional -t (and sometimes -s) argument with one of target-client,
     target-session target-window, or target-pane.  These specify the client, session,
     window or pane which a command should affect.

     target-client should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4) file to which
     the client is connected, for example either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the client
     attached to /dev/ttyp1.  If no client is specified, tmux attempts to work out the
     client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients may be listed
     with the list-clients command.

     target-session is tried as, in order:

           1.   A session ID prefixed with a $.

           2.   An exact name of a session (as listed by the list-sessions command).

           3.   The start of a session name, for example &#8216;mysess&#8217; would match a session
                named &#8216;mysession&#8217;.

           4.   An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.

     If the session name is prefixed with an &#8216;=&#8217;, only an exact match is accepted (so
     &#8216;=mysess&#8217; will only match exactly &#8216;mysess&#8217;, not &#8216;mysession&#8217;).

     If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches
     produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the current session is used if avail&#8208;
     able; if no current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.

     target-window (or src-window or dst-window) specifies a window in the form
     session:window.  session follows the same rules as for target-session, and window is
     looked for in order as:

           1.   A special token, listed below.

           2.   A window index, for example &#8216;mysession:1&#8217; is window 1 in session
                &#8216;mysession&#8217;.

           3.   A window ID, such as @1.

           4.   An exact window name, such as &#8216;mysession:mywindow&#8217;.

           5.   The start of a window name, such as &#8216;mysession:mywin&#8217;.

           6.   As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.

     Like sessions, a &#8216;=&#8217; prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name spec&#8208;
     ifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example the new-window and
     link-window commands) otherwise the current window in session is chosen.

     The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has
     a single-character alternative form.

     Token              Meaning
     {start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
     {end}         $    The highest-numbered window
     {last}        !    The last (previously current) window
     {next}        +    The next window by number
     {previous}    -    The previous window by number

     target-pane (or src-pane or dst-pane) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to
     target-window but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index or
     pane ID, for example: &#8216;mysession:mywindow.1&#8217;.  If the pane index is omitted, the
     currently active pane in the specified window is used.  The following special tokens
     are available for the pane index:

     Token                  Meaning
     {last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
     {next}            +    The next pane by number
     {previous}        -    The previous pane by number
     {top}                  The top pane
     {bottom}               The bottom pane
     {left}                 The leftmost pane
     {right}                The rightmost pane
     {top-left}             The top-left pane
     {top-right}            The top-right pane
     {bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
     {bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
     {up-of}                The pane above the active pane
     {down-of}              The pane below the active pane
     {left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
     {right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane

     The tokens &#8216;+&#8217; and &#8216;-&#8217; may be followed by an offset, for example:

           select-window -t:+2

     In addition, target-session, target-window or target-pane may consist entirely of
     the token &#8216;{mouse}&#8217; (alternative form &#8216;=&#8217;) to specify the most recent mouse event
     (see the MOUSE SUPPORT section) or &#8216;{marked}&#8217; (alternative form &#8216;~&#8217;) to specify the
     marked pane (see select-pane -m).

     Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are pre&#8208;
     fixed with a &#8216;$&#8217;, windows with a &#8216;@&#8217;, and panes with a &#8216;%&#8217;.  These are unique and
     are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane in the tmux server.  The
     pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment
     variable.  IDs may be displayed using the &#8216;session_id&#8217;, &#8216;window_id&#8217;, or &#8216;pane_id&#8217;
     formats (see the FORMATS section) and the display-message, list-sessions,
     list-windows or list-panes commands.

     shell-command arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to
     the shell, for example:

           new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Will run:

           /bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'

     Additionally, the new-window, new-session, split-window, respawn-window and
     respawn-pane commands allow shell-command to be given as multiple arguments and exe&#8208;
     cuted directly (without &#8216;sh -c&#8217;).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For
     example:

           $ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd

     Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.

     command [arguments] refers to a tmux command, passed with the command and arguments
     separately, for example:

           bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Or if using sh(1):

           $ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81

     Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a command sequence.  Each
     command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon; commands are executed sequen&#8208;
     tially from left to right and lines ending with a backslash continue on to the next
     line, except when escaped by another backslash.  A literal semicolon may be included
     by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to
     bind-key).

     Example tmux commands include:

           refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2

           rename-session -tfirst newname

           set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on

           new-window ; split-window -d

           bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
                   display-message "source-file done"

     Or from sh(1):

           $ tmux kill-window -t :1

           $ tmux new-window \; split-window -d

           $ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach

CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
     The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached
     to sessions to interact with them, either when they are created with the new-session
     command, or later with the attach-session command.  Each session has one or more
     windows linked into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up
     of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Commands for creat&#8208;
     ing, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the WINDOWS AND PANES
     section.

     The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:

     attach-session [-dEr] [-c working-directory] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: attach)
             If run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current terminal and
             attach it to target-session.  If used from inside, switch the current
             client.  If -d is specified, any other clients attached to the session are
             detached.  -r signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the
             detach-client or switch-client commands have any effect)

             If no server is started, attach-session will attempt to start it; this will
             fail unless sessions are created in the configuration file.

             The target-session rules for attach-session are slightly adjusted: if tmux
             needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most
             recently used unattached session.

             -c will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to
             working-directory.

             If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.

     detach-client [-aP] [-E shell-command] [-s target-session] [-t target-client]
                   (alias: detach)
             Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with -t,
             or all clients currently attached to the session specified by -s.  The -a
             option kills all but the client given with -t.  If -P is given, send SIGHUP
             to the parent process of the client, typically causing it to exit.  With -E,
             run shell-command to replace the client.

     has-session [-t target-session]
                   (alias: has)
             Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If
             it does exist, exit with 0.

     kill-server
             Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all sessions.

     kill-session [-aC] [-t target-session]
             Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other
             sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.  If -a is given, all
             sessions but the specified one is killed.  The -C flag clears alerts (bell,
             activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the session.

     list-clients [-F format] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: lsc)
             List all clients attached to the server.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
             see the FORMATS section.  If target-session is specified, list only clients
             connected to that session.

     list-commands [-F format]
                   (alias: lscm)
             List the syntax of all commands supported by tmux.

     list-sessions [-F format]
                   (alias: ls)
             List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
             see the FORMATS section.

     lock-client [-t target-client]
                   (alias: lockc)
             Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.

     lock-session [-t target-session]
                   (alias: locks)
             Lock all clients attached to target-session.

     new-session [-AdDEP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s
             session-name] [-t group-name] [-x width] [-y height] [shell-command]
                   (alias: new)
             Create a new session with name session-name.

             The new session is attached to the current terminal unless -d is given.
             window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell command to execute
             in the initial window.  With -d, the initial size is 80 x 24; -x and -y can
             be used to specify a different size.

             If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are saved and used
             for new windows in the new session.

             The -A flag makes new-session behave like attach-session if session-name
             already exists; in this case, -D behaves like -d to attach-session.

             If -t is given, it specifies a session group.  Sessions in the same group
             share the same set of windows - new windows are linked to all sessions in
             the group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.  The current and
             previous window and any session options remain independent and any session
             in a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The group-name argu&#8208;
             ment may be:

             1.      the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is
                     added to that group;

             2.      the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the
                     same group as that session, creating a new group if necessary;

             3.      the name for a new group containing only the new session.

             -n and shell-command are invalid if -t is used.

             The -P option prints information about the new session after it has been
             created.  By default, it uses the format &#8216;#{session_name}:&#8217; but a different
             format may be specified with -F.

             If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.

     refresh-client [-C width,height] [-S] [-t target-client]
                   (alias: refresh)
             Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is
             given with -t.  If -S is specified, only update the client's status line.

             -C sets the width and height of a control client.

     rename-session [-t target-session] new-name
                   (alias: rename)
             Rename the session to new-name.

     show-messages [-JT] [-t target-client]
                   (alias: showmsgs)
             Show client messages or server information.  Any messages displayed on the
             status line are saved in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the
             limit set by the message-limit server option.  With -t, display the log for
             target-client.  -J and -T show debugging information about jobs and termi&#8208;
             nals.

     source-file [-q] path
                   (alias: source)
             Execute commands from path (which may be a glob(3) pattern).  If -q is
             given, no error will be returned if path does not exist.

             Within a configuration file, commands may be made conditional by surrounding
             them with %if and %endif lines.  Additional %elif and %else lines may also
             be used.  The argument to %if and %elif is expanded as a format and if it
             evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent lines are ignored until the
             next %elif, %else or %endif.  For example:

                   %if #{==:#{host},myhost}
                   set -g status-style bg=red
                   %elif #{==:#{host},myotherhost}
                   set -g status-style bg=green
                   %else
                   set -g status-style bg=blue
                   %endif

             Will change the status line to red if running on &#8216;myhost&#8217;, green if running
             on &#8216;myotherhost&#8217;, or blue if running on another host.

     start-server
                   (alias: start)
             Start the tmux server, if not already running, without creating any ses&#8208;
             sions.

     suspend-client [-t target-client]
                   (alias: suspendc)
             Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).

     switch-client [-Elnpr] [-c target-client] [-t target-session] [-T key-table]
                   (alias: switchc)
             Switch the current session for client target-client to target-session.  If
             -l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous ses&#8208;
             sion respectively.  -r toggles whether a client is read-only (see the
             attach-session command).

             If -E is used, update-environment option will not be applied.

             -T sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be inter&#8208;
             preted from key-table.  This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys,
             or to bind commands to sequences of keys.  For example, to make typing &#8216;abc&#8217;
             run the list-keys command:

                   bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
                   bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
                   bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1

WINDOWS AND PANES
     A tmux window may be in one of two modes.  The default permits direct access to the
     terminal attached to the window.  The other is copy mode, which permits a section of
     a window or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into
     another window.  This mode is entered with the copy-mode command, bound to &#8216;[&#8217; by
     default.  It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as list-keys,
     is executed from a key binding.

     Commands are sent to copy mode using the -X flag to the send-keys command.  When a
     key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables, depending on the
     mode-keys option: copy-mode for emacs, or copy-mode-vi for vi.  Key tables may be
     viewed with the list-keys command.

     The following commands are supported in copy mode:

           Command                              vi              emacs

           top-line                             H               M-R

     The &#8216;-and-cancel&#8217; variants of some commands exit copy mode after they have completed
     (for copy commands) or when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).

     The next and previous word keys use space and the &#8216;-&#8217;, &#8216;_&#8217; and &#8216;@&#8217; characters as
     word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the word-separators
     session option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the
     end of the next word and previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three
     next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word sepa&#8208;
     rator.

     The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing &#8216;f&#8217;
     followed by &#8216;/&#8217; will move the cursor to the next &#8216;/&#8217; character on the current line.
     A &#8216;;&#8217; will then jump to the next occurrence.

     Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key
     bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key
     and a number begins prefix entry.

     The synopsis for the copy-mode command is:

     copy-mode [-Meu] [-t target-pane]
             Enter copy mode.  The -u option scrolls one page up.  -M begins a mouse drag
             (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).  -e speci&#8208;
             fies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen)
             should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those
             used for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to allow
             fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:

                   bind PageUp copy-mode -eu

     Each window displayed by tmux may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes
     up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split
     into panes using the split-window command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with
     the -h flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the resize-pane command
     (bound to &#8216;C-Up&#8217;, &#8216;C-Down&#8217; &#8216;C-Left&#8217; and &#8216;C-Right&#8217; by default), the current pane may
     be changed with the select-pane command and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands
     may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered
     beginning from zero in the order they are created.

     A number of preset layouts are available.  These may be selected with the
     select-layout command or cycled with next-layout (bound to &#8216;Space&#8217; by default); once
     a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.

     The following layouts are supported:

     even-horizontal
             Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.

     even-vertical
             Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.

     main-horizontal
             A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining
             panes are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.
             Use the main-pane-height window option to specify the height of the top
             pane.

     main-vertical
             Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the left and the
             others spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the main-pane-width
             window option.

     tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and
             columns.

     In addition, select-layout may be used to apply a previously used layout - the
     list-windows command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use
     with select-layout.  For example:

           $ tmux list-windows
           0: ksh [159x48]
               layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
           $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

     tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note
     that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the
     layout was originally defined.

     Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:

     break-pane [-dP] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: breakp)
             Break src-pane off from its containing window to make it the only pane in
             dst-window.  If -d is given, the new window does not become the current win&#8208;
             dow.  The -P option prints information about the new window after it has
             been created.  By default, it uses the format
             &#8216;#{session_name}:#{window_index}&#8217; but a different format may be specified
             with -F.

     capture-pane [-aepPqCJ] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t
             target-pane]
                   (alias: capturep)
             Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the output goes to stdout,
             otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or a new buffer if omitted.  If -a
             is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.
             If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless -q is given.
             If -e is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background
             attributes.  -C also escapes non-printable characters as octal \xxx.  -J
             joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.  -P
             captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of
             an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.

             -S and -E specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first
             line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  &#8216;-&#8217;
             to -S is the start of the history and to -E the end of the visible pane.
             The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.

     choose-client [-NZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane]
             [template]
             Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively
             from a list.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in client
             mode:

                   Key    Function
                   Enter  Choose selected client
                   Up     Select previous client
                   Down   Select next client
                   C-s    Search by name
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if client is tagged
                   T      Tag no clients
                   C-t    Tag all clients
                   d      Detach selected client
                   D      Detach tagged clients
                   x      Detach and HUP selected client
                   X      Detach and HUP tagged clients
                   z      Suspend selected client
                   Z      Suspend tagged clients
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a client is chosen, &#8216;%%&#8217; is replaced by the client name in template
             and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "detach-
             client -t '%%'" is used.

             -O specifies the initial sort order: one of &#8216;name&#8217;, &#8216;size&#8217;, &#8216;creation&#8217;, or
             &#8216;activity&#8217;.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it
             evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.
             If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the
             format for each item in the list.  -N starts without the preview.  This com&#8208;
             mand works only if at least one client is attached.

     choose-tree [-GNswZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane]
             [template]
             Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen
             interactively from a list.  -s starts with sessions collapsed and -w with
             windows collapsed.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in
             tree mode:

                   Key    Function
                   Enter  Choose selected item
                   Up     Select previous item
                   Down   Select next item
                   &lt;      Scroll list of previews left
                   &gt;      Scroll list of previews right
                   C-s    Search by name
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if item is tagged
                   T      Tag no items
                   C-t    Tag all items
                   :      Run a command for each tagged item
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a session, window or pane is chosen, &#8216;%%&#8217; is replaced by the target in
             template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given,
             "switch-client -t '%%'" is used.

             -O specifies the initial sort order: one of &#8216;index&#8217;, &#8216;name&#8217;, or &#8216;time&#8217;.  -f
             specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to
             zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter
             would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for
             each item in the tree.  -N starts without the preview.  -G includes all ses&#8208;
             sions in any session groups in the tree rather than only the first.  This
             command works only if at least one client is attached.

     display-panes [-d duration] [-t target-client] [template]
                   (alias: displayp)
             Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client.  See the
             display-panes-colour and display-panes-active-colour session options.  The
             indicator is closed when a key is pressed or duration milliseconds have
             passed.  If -d is not given, display-panes-time is used.  A duration of zero
             means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator is on
             screen, a pane may be chosen with the &#8216;0&#8217; to &#8216;9&#8217; keys, which will cause
             template to be executed as a command with &#8216;%%&#8217; substituted by the pane ID.
             The default template is "select-pane -t '%%'".

     find-window [-CNT] [-t target-pane] match-string
                   (alias: findw)
             Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window names, titles, and
             visible content (but not history).  The flags control matching behavior: -C
             matches only visible window contents, -N matches only the window name and -T
             matches only the window title.  The default is -CNT.

             This command works only if at least one client is attached.

     join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: joinp)
             Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new
             pane, split it and move src-pane into the space.  This can be used to
             reverse break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane to be joined to left of
             or above dst-pane.

             If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the
             marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: killp)
             Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is
             also destroyed.  The -a option kills all but the pane given with -t.

     kill-window [-a] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: killw)
             Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any
             sessions to which it is linked.  The -a option kills all but the window
             given with -t.

     last-pane [-de] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: lastp)
             Select the last (previously selected) pane.  -e enables or -d disables input
             to the pane.

     last-window [-t target-session]
                   (alias: last)
             Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no target-session is spec&#8208;
             ified, select the last window of the current session.

     link-window [-adk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: linkw)
             Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.  If dst-window is
             specified and no such window exists, the src-window is linked there.  With
             -a, the window is moved to the next index up (following windows are moved if
             necessary).  If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise
             an error is generated.  If -d is given, the newly linked window is not
             selected.

     list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-t target]
                   (alias: lsp)
             If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.
             If -s is given, target is a session (or the current session).  If neither is
             given, target is a window (or the current window).  For the meaning of the
             -F flag, see the FORMATS section.

     list-windows [-a] [-F format] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: lsw)
             If -a is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list windows in
             the current session or in target-session.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
             see the FORMATS section.

     move-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: movep)
             Like join-pane, but src-pane and dst-pane may belong to the same window.

     move-window [-ardk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: movew)
             This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window is moved to
             dst-window.  With -r, all windows in the session are renumbered in sequen&#8208;
             tial order, respecting the base-index option.

     new-window [-adkP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t
             target-window] [shell-command]
                   (alias: neww)
             Create a new window.  With -a, the new window is inserted at the next index
             up from the specified target-window, moving windows up if necessary, other&#8208;
             wise target-window is the new window location.

             If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.
             target-window represents the window to be created; if the target already
             exists an error is shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is
             destroyed.  shell-command is the command to execute.  If shell-command is
             not specified, the value of the default-command option is used.  -c speci&#8208;
             fies the working directory in which the new window is created.

             When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the remain-on-exit
             option to change this behaviour.

             The TERM environment variable must be set to &#8216;screen&#8217; or &#8216;tmux&#8217; for all pro&#8208;
             grams running inside tmux.  New windows will automatically have
             &#8216;TERM=screen&#8217; added to their environment, but care must be taken not to
             reset this in shell start-up files.

             The -P option prints information about the new window after it has been cre&#8208;
             ated.  By default, it uses the format &#8216;#{session_name}:#{window_index}&#8217; but
             a different format may be specified with -F.

     next-layout [-t target-window]
                   (alias: nextl)
             Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.

     next-window [-a] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: next)
             Move to the next window in the session.  If -a is used, move to the next
             window with an alert.

     pipe-pane [-IOo] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
                   (alias: pipep)
             Pipe output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command or vice
             versa.  A pane may only be connected to one command at a time, any existing
             pipe is closed before shell-command is executed.  The shell-command string
             may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left
             option.  If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.

             -I and -O specify which of the shell-command output streams are connected to
             the pane: with -I stdout is connected (so anything shell-command prints is
             written to the pane as if it were typed); with -O stdin is connected (so any
             output in the pane is piped to shell-command).  Both may be used together
             and if neither are specified, -O is used.

             The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a
             pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:

                   bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P'

     previous-layout [-t target-window]
                   (alias: prevl)
             Move to the previous layout in the session.

     previous-window [-a] [-t target-session]
                   (alias: prev)
             Move to the previous window in the session.  With -a, move to the previous
             window with an alert.

     rename-window [-t target-window] new-name
                   (alias: renamew)
             Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to
             new-name.

     resize-pane [-DLMRUZ] [-t target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment]
                   (alias: resizep)
             Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U, -D, -L or -R,
             or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The adjustment is given in lines or
             cells (the default is 1).

             With -Z, the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of
             the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).

             -M begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
             MOUSE SUPPORT).

     respawn-pane [-c start-directory] [-k] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
                   (alias: respawnp)
             Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit
             window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the
             pane was created is executed.  The pane must be already inactive, unless -k
             is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a new
             working directory for the pane.

     respawn-window [-c start-directory] [-k] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
                   (alias: respawnw)
             Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit
             window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the
             window was created is executed.  The window must be already inactive, unless
             -k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a
             new working directory for the window.

     rotate-window [-DU] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: rotatew)
             Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numeri&#8208;
             cally lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).

     select-layout [-Enop] [-t target-pane] [layout-name]
                   (alias: selectl)
             Choose a specific layout for a window.  If layout-name is not given, the
             last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.  -n and -p are equivalent to
             the next-layout and previous-layout commands.  -o applies the last set lay&#8208;
             out if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).  -E spreads the cur&#8208;
             rent pane and any panes next to it out evenly.

     select-pane [-DdegLlMmRU] [-P style] [-T title] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: selectp)
             Make pane target-pane the active pane in window target-window, or set its
             style (with -P).  If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane
             below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used.  -l is
             the same as using the last-pane command.  -e enables or -d disables input to
             the pane.

             -m and -M are used to set and clear the marked pane.  There is one marked
             pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the last.  The marked pane
             is the default target for -s to join-pane, swap-pane and swap-window.

             Each pane has a style: by default the window-style and window-active-style
             options are used, select-pane -P sets the style for a single pane.  For
             example, to set the pane 1 background to red:

                   select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'

             -g shows the current pane style.

             -T sets the pane title.

     select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: selectw)
             Select the window at target-window.  -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the
             last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.  If -T is given and
             the selected window is already the current window, the command behaves like
             last-window.

     split-window [-bdfhvP] [-c start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t
             target-pane] [shell-command] [-F format]
                   (alias: splitw)
             Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal split and
             -v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is assumed.  The -l and -p
             options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
             cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage, respectively.  The -b
             option causes the new pane to be created to the left of or above
             target-pane.  The -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window
             height (with -h) or full window width (with -v), instead of splitting the
             active pane.  All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window
             command.

     swap-pane [-dDU] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
                   (alias: swapp)
             Swap two panes.  If -U is used and no source pane is specified with -s,
             dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); -D swaps
             with the next pane (after it numerically).  -d instructs tmux not to change
             the active pane.

             If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the
             marked pane is used rather than the current pane.

     swap-window [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
                   (alias: swapw)
             This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination windows
             are swapped.  It is an error if no window exists at src-window.

             Like swap-pane, if -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
             select-pane -m), the window containing the marked pane is used rather than
             the current window.

     unlink-window [-k] [-t target-window]
                   (alias: unlinkw)
             Unlink target-window.  Unless -k is given, a window may be unlinked only if
             it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no ses&#8208;
             sions; if -k is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it
             is unlinked and destroyed.

KEY BINDINGS
     tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When
     specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example &#8216;A&#8217; to &#8216;Z&#8217;).  Ctrl keys may
     be prefixed with &#8216;C-&#8217; or &#8216;^&#8217;, and Alt (meta) with &#8216;M-&#8217;.  In addition, the following
     special key names are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab, DC (Delete),
     End, Enter, Escape, F1 to F12, Home, IC (Insert), NPage/PageDown/PgDn,
     PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab.  Note that to bind the &#8216;"&#8217; or &#8216;'&#8217; keys, quotation
     marks are necessary, for example:

           bind-key '"' split-window
           bind-key "'" new-window

     Commands related to key bindings are as follows:

     bind-key [-nr] [-T key-table] key command [arguments]
                   (alias: bind)
             Bind key key to command.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (with&#8208;
             out -T), the key is bound in the prefix key table.  This table is used for
             keys pressed after the prefix key (for example, by default &#8216;c&#8217; is bound to
             new-window in the prefix table, so &#8216;C-b c&#8217; creates a new window).  The root
             table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding &#8216;c&#8217; to
             new-window in the root table (not recommended) means a plain &#8216;c&#8217; will create
             a new window.  -n is an alias for -T root.  Keys may also be bound in custom
             key tables and the switch-client -T command used to switch to them from a
             key binding.  The -r flag indicates this key may repeat, see the repeat-time
             option.

             To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the list-keys com&#8208;
             mand.

     list-keys [-T key-table]
                   (alias: lsk)
             List all key bindings.  Without -T all key tables are printed.  With -T only
             key-table.

     send-keys [-lMRX] [-N repeat-count] [-t target-pane] key ...
                   (alias: send)
             Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument key is the name of the key
             (such as &#8216;C-a&#8217; or &#8216;NPage&#8217;) to send; if the string is not recognised as a
             key, it is sent as a series of characters.  The -l flag disables key name
             lookup and sends the keys literally.  All arguments are sent sequentially
             from first to last.  The -R flag causes the terminal state to be reset.

             -M passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding,
             see MOUSE SUPPORT).

             -X is used to send a command into copy mode - see the WINDOWS AND PANES sec&#8208;
             tion.  -N specifies a repeat count.

     send-prefix [-2] [-t target-pane]
             Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if
             it was pressed.

     unbind-key [-an] [-T key-table] key
                   (alias: unbind)
             Unbind the command bound to key.  -n and -T are the same as for bind-key.
             If -a is present, all key bindings are removed.

OPTIONS
     The appearance and behaviour of tmux may be modified by changing the value of vari&#8208;
     ous options.  There are three types of option: server options, session options and
     window options.

     The tmux server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular
     window or session.  These are altered with the set-option -s command, or displayed
     with the show-options -s command.

     In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is
     a separate set of global session options.  Sessions which do not have a particular
     option configured inherit the value from the global session options.  Session
     options are set or unset with the set-option command and may be listed with the
     show-options command.  The available server and session options are listed under the
     set-option command.

     Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of
     global window options from which any unset options are inherited.  Window options
     are altered with the set-window-option command and can be listed with the
     show-window-options command.  All window options are documented with the
     set-window-option command.

     tmux also supports user options which are prefixed with a &#8216;@&#8217;.  User options may
     have any name, so long as they are prefixed with &#8216;@&#8217;, and be set to any string.  For
     example:

           $ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
           $ tmux showw -v @foo
           abc123

     Commands which set options are as follows:

     set-option [-aFgoqsuw] [-t target-session | target-window] option value
                   (alias: set)
             Set a window option with -w (equivalent to the set-window-option command), a
             server option with -s, otherwise a session option.  If -g is given, the
             global session or window option is set.  -F expands formats in the option
             value.  The -u flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from
             the global options (or with -g, restores a global option to the default).

             The -o flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the -q flag
             suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.

             With -a, and if the option expects a string or a style, value is appended to
             the existing setting.  For example:

                   set -g status-left "foo"
                   set -ag status-left "bar"

             Will result in &#8216;foobar&#8217;.  And:

                   set -g status-style "bg=red"
                   set -ag status-style "fg=blue"

             Will result in a red background and blue foreground.  Without -a, the result
             would be the default background and a blue foreground.

             Available window options are listed under set-window-option.

             value depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on,
             off, or omitted to toggle).

             Available server options are:

             buffer-limit number
                     Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of
                     the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to
                     maintain this maximum length.

             command-alias[] name=value
                     This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an unknown com&#8208;
                     mand matches name, it is replaced with value.  For example, after:

                           set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'

                     Using:

                           zoom -t:.1

                     Is equivalent to:

                           resize-pane -Z -t:.1

                     Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed rather than
                     when it is executed, so binding an alias with bind-key will bind the
                     expanded form.

             default-terminal terminal
                     Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session -
                     the default value of the TERM environment variable.  For tmux to
                     work correctly, this must be set to &#8216;screen&#8217;, &#8216;tmux&#8217; or a derivative
                     of them.

             escape-time time
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an escape is
                     input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key
                     sequences.  The default is 500 milliseconds.

             exit-empty [on | off]
                     If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there are no
                     active sessions.

             exit-unattached [on | off]
                     If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.

             focus-events [on | off]
                     When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if sup&#8208;
                     ported and passed through to applications running in tmux.  Attached
                     clients should be detached and attached again after changing this
                     option.

             history-file path
                     If not empty, a file to which tmux will write command prompt history
                     on exit and load it from on start.

             message-limit number
                     Set the number of error or information messages to save in the mes&#8208;
                     sage log for each client.  The default is 100.

             set-clipboard [on | external | off]
                     Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the xterm(1)
                     escape sequence, if there is an Ms entry in the terminfo(5) descrip&#8208;
                     tion (see the TERMINFO EXTENSIONS section).

                     If set to on, tmux will both accept the escape sequence to create a
                     buffer and attempt to set the terminal clipboard.  If set to
                     external, tmux will attempt to set the terminal clipboard but ignore
                     attempts by applications to set tmux buffers.  If off, tmux will
                     neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor attempt to set the
                     clipboard.

                     Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting
                     the resource:

                           disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop

                     Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when
                     required.

             terminal-overrides[] string
                     Allow terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5) to be overridden.
                     Each entry is a colon-separated string made up of a terminal type
                     pattern (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a set of name=value entries.

                     For example, to set the &#8216;clear&#8217; terminfo(5) entry to &#8216;\e[H\e[2J&#8217; for
                     all terminal types matching &#8216;rxvt*&#8217;:

                           rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J

                     The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before inter&#8208;
                     pretation.

             Available session options are:

             activity-action [any | none | current | other]
                     Set action on window activity when monitor-activity is on.  any
                     means activity in any window linked to a session causes a bell or
                     message (depending on visual-activity) in the current window of that
                     session, none means all activity is ignored (equivalent to
                     monitor-activity being off), current means only activity in windows
                     other than the current window are ignored and other means activity
                     in the current window is ignored but not those in other windows.

             assume-paste-time milliseconds
                     If keys are entered faster than one in milliseconds, they are
                     assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and tmux key bindings
                     are not processed.  The default is one millisecond and zero dis&#8208;
                     ables.

             base-index index
                     Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched
                     when a new window is created.  The default is zero.

             bell-action [any | none | current | other]
                     Set action on a bell in a window when monitor-bell is on.  The val&#8208;
                     ues are the same as those for activity-action.

             default-command shell-command
                     Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the win&#8208;
                     dow is created) to shell-command, which may be any sh(1) command.
                     The default is an empty string, which instructs tmux to create a
                     login shell using the value of the default-shell option.

             default-shell path
                     Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login shell for new
                     windows when the default-command option is set to empty, and must be
                     the full path of the executable.  When started tmux tries to set a
                     default value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment vari&#8208;
                     able, the shell returned by getpwuid(3), or /bin/sh.  This option
                     should be configured when tmux is used as a login shell.

             destroy-unattached [on | off]
                     If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it
                     is destroyed.

             detach-on-destroy [on | off]
                     If on (the default), the client is detached when the session it is
                     attached to is destroyed.  If off, the client is switched to the
                     most recently active of the remaining sessions.

             display-panes-active-colour colour
                     Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the indica&#8208;
                     tor for the active pane.

             display-panes-colour colour
                     Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the indica&#8208;
                     tors for inactive panes.

             display-panes-time time
                     Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown by the
                     display-panes command appear.

             display-time time
                     Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-
                     screen indicators are displayed.  If set to 0, messages and indica&#8208;
                     tors are displayed until a key is pressed.  time is in milliseconds.

             history-limit lines
                     Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.  This set&#8208;
                     ting applies only to new windows - existing window histories are not
                     resized and retain the limit at the point they were created.

             key-table key-table
                     Set the default key table to key-table instead of root.

             lock-after-time number
                     Lock the session (like the lock-session command) after number sec&#8208;
                     onds of inactivity.  The default is not to lock (set to 0).

             lock-command shell-command
                     Command to run when locking each client.  The default is to run
                     lock(1) with -np.

             message-command-style style
                     Set status line message command style, where style is a comma-sepa&#8208;
                     rated list of characteristics to be specified.

                     These may be &#8216;bg=colour&#8217; to set the background colour, &#8216;fg=colour&#8217;
                     to set the foreground colour, and a list of attributes as specified
                     below.

                     The colour is one of: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
                     cyan, white, aixterm bright variants (if supported: brightred,
                     brightgreen, and so on), colour0 to colour255 from the 256-colour
                     set, default, or a hexadecimal RGB string such as &#8216;#ffffff&#8217;, which
                     chooses the closest match from the default 256-colour set.

                     The attributes is either none or a comma-delimited list of one or
                     more of: bright (or bold), dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden,
                     italics, or strikethrough to turn an attribute on, or an attribute
                     prefixed with &#8216;no&#8217; to turn one off.

                     Examples are:

                           fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
                           bg=black,fg=default,noreverse

                     With the -a flag to the set-option command the new style is added
                     otherwise the existing style is replaced.

             message-style style
                     Set status line message style.  For how to specify style, see the
                     message-command-style option.

             mouse [on | off]
                     If on, tmux captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be bound
                     as key bindings.  See the MOUSE SUPPORT section for details.

             prefix key
                     Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the standard
                     keys described under KEY BINDINGS, prefix can be set to the special
                     key &#8216;None&#8217; to set no prefix.

             prefix2 key
                     Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like prefix, prefix2
                     can be set to &#8216;None&#8217;.

             renumber-windows [on | off]
                     If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically renumber
                     the other windows in numerical order.  This respects the base-index
                     option if it has been set.  If off, do not renumber the windows.

             repeat-time time
                     Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-
                     key again in the specified time milliseconds (the default is 500).
                     Whether a key repeats may be set when it is bound using the -r flag
                     to bind-key.  Repeat is enabled for the default keys bound to the
                     resize-pane command.

             set-titles [on | off]
                     Attempt to set the client terminal title using the tsl and fsl
                     terminfo(5) entries if they exist.  tmux automatically sets these to
                     the \e]0;...\007 sequence if the terminal appears to be xterm(1).
                     This option is off by default.

             set-titles-string string
                     String used to set the window title if set-titles is on.  Formats
                     are expanded, see the FORMATS section.

             silence-action [any | none | current | other]
                     Set action on window silence when monitor-silence is on.  The values
                     are the same as those for activity-action.

             status [on | off]
                     Show or hide the status line.

             status-interval interval
                     Update the status line every interval seconds.  By default, updates
                     will occur every 15 seconds.  A setting of zero disables redrawing
                     at interval.

             status-justify [left | centre | right]
                     Set the position of the window list component of the status line:
                     left, centre or right justified.

             status-keys [vi | emacs]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example
                     at the command prompt.  The default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or
                     EDITOR environment variables are set and contain the string &#8216;vi&#8217;.

             status-left string
                     Display string (by default the session name) to the left of the sta&#8208;
                     tus line.  string will be passed through strftime(3) and formats
                     (see FORMATS) will be expanded.  It may also contain the special
                     character sequence #[] to change the colour or attributes, for exam&#8208;
                     ple &#8216;#[fg=red,bright]&#8217; to set a bright red foreground.  See the
                     message-command-style option for a description of colours and
                     attributes.

                     For details on how the names and titles can be set see the NAMES AND
                     TITLES section.

                     Examples are:

                           #(sysctl vm.loadavg)
                           #[fg=yellow,bold]#(apm -l)%%#[default] [#S]

                     The default is &#8216;[#S] &#8217;.

             status-left-length length
                     Set the maximum length of the left component of the status line.
                     The default is 10.

             status-left-style style
                     Set the style of the left part of the status line.  For how to spec&#8208;
                     ify style, see the message-command-style option.

             status-position [top | bottom]
                     Set the position of the status line.

             status-right string
                     Display string to the right of the status line.  By default, the
                     current pane title in double quotes, the date and the time are
                     shown.  As with status-left, string will be passed to strftime(3)
                     and character pairs are replaced.

             status-right-length length
                     Set the maximum length of the right component of the status line.
                     The default is 40.

             status-right-style style
                     Set the style of the right part of the status line.  For how to
                     specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             status-style style
                     Set status line style.  For how to specify style, see the
                     message-command-style option.

             update-environment[] variable
                     Set list of environment variables to be copied into the session
                     environment when a new session is created or an existing session is
                     attached.  Any variables that do not exist in the source environment
                     are set to be removed from the session environment (as if -r was
                     given to the set-environment command).

             user-keys[] key
                     Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each item is associ&#8208;
                     ated with a key named &#8216;User0&#8217;, &#8216;User1&#8217;, and so on.

                     For example:

                           set -s user-keys[0] "\e[5;30012~"
                           bind User0 resize-pane -L 3

             visual-activity [on | off | both]
                     If on, display a message instead of sending a bell when activity
                     occurs in a window for which the monitor-activity window option is
                     enabled.  If set to both, a bell and a message are produced.

             visual-bell [on | off | both]
                     If on, a message is shown on a bell in a window for which the
                     monitor-bell window option is enabled instead of it being passed
                     through to the terminal (which normally makes a sound).  If set to
                     both, a bell and a message are produced.  Also see the bell-action
                     option.

             visual-silence [on | off | both]
                     If monitor-silence is enabled, prints a message after the interval
                     has expired on a given window instead of sending a bell.  If set to
                     both, a bell and a message are produced.

             word-separators string
                     Sets the session's conception of what characters are considered word
                     separators, for the purposes of the next and previous word commands
                     in copy mode.  The default is &#8216; -_@&#8217;.

     set-window-option [-aFgoqu] [-t target-window] option value
                   (alias: setw)
             Set a window option.  The -a, -F, -g, -o, -q and -u flags work similarly to
             the set-option command.

             Supported window options are:

             aggressive-resize [on | off]
                     Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that tmux will
                     resize the window to the size of the smallest session for which it
                     is the current window, rather than the smallest session to which it
                     is attached.  The window may resize when the current window is
                     changed on another sessions; this option is good for full-screen
                     programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs
                     such as shells.

             allow-rename [on | off]
                     Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal escape
                     sequence (\ek...\e\\).  The default is off.

             alternate-screen [on | off]
                     This option configures whether programs running inside tmux may use
                     the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows the smcup and
                     rmcup terminfo(5) capabilities.  The alternate screen feature pre&#8208;
                     serves the contents of the window when an interactive application
                     starts and restores it on exit, so that any output visible before
                     the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.  The
                     default is on.

             automatic-rename [on | off]
                     Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting is enabled,
                     tmux will rename the window automatically using the format specified
                     by automatic-rename-format.  This flag is automatically disabled for
                     an individual window when a name is specified at creation with
                     new-window or new-session, or later with rename-window, or with a
                     terminal escape sequence.  It may be switched off globally with:

                           set-window-option -g automatic-rename off

             automatic-rename-format format
                     The format (see FORMATS) used when the automatic-rename option is
                     enabled.

             clock-mode-colour colour
                     Set clock colour.

             clock-mode-style [12 | 24]
                     Set clock hour format.

             force-height height
             force-width width
                     Prevent tmux from resizing a window to greater than width or height.
                     A value of zero restores the default unlimited setting.

             main-pane-height height
             main-pane-width width
                     Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in the
                     main-horizontal or main-vertical layouts.

             mode-keys [vi | emacs]
                     Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy mode.  The default is
                     emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR contains &#8216;vi&#8217;.

             mode-style style
                     Set window modes style.  For how to specify style, see the
                     message-command-style option.

             monitor-activity [on | off]
                     Monitor for activity in the window.  Windows with activity are high&#8208;
                     lighted in the status line.

             monitor-bell [on | off]
                     Monitor for a bell in the window.  Windows with a bell are high&#8208;
                     lighted in the status line.

             monitor-silence [interval]
                     Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within interval sec&#8208;
                     onds.  Windows that have been silent for the interval are high&#8208;
                     lighted in the status line.  An interval of zero disables the moni&#8208;
                     toring.

             other-pane-height height
                     Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the
                     main-horizontal layout.  If this option is set to 0 (the default),
                     it will have no effect.  If both the main-pane-height and
                     other-pane-height options are set, the main pane will grow taller to
                     make the other panes the specified height, but will never shrink to
                     do so.

             other-pane-width width
                     Like other-pane-height, but set the width of other panes in the
                     main-vertical layout.

             pane-active-border-style style
                     Set the pane border style for the currently active pane.  For how to
                     specify style, see the message-command-style option.  Attributes are
                     ignored.

             pane-base-index index
                     Like base-index, but set the starting index for pane numbers.

             pane-border-format format
                     Set the text shown in pane border status lines.

             pane-border-status [off | top | bottom]
                     Turn pane border status lines off or set their position.

             pane-border-style style
                     Set the pane border style for panes aside from the active pane.  For
                     how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.
                     Attributes are ignored.

             remain-on-exit [on | off]
                     A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the program run&#8208;
                     ning in it exits.  The window may be reactivated with the
                     respawn-window command.

             synchronize-panes [on | off]
                     Duplicate input to any pane to all other panes in the same window
                     (only for panes that are not in any special mode).

             window-active-style style
                     Set the style for the window's active pane.  For how to specify
                     style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-activity-style style
                     Set status line style for windows with an activity alert.  For how
                     to specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-bell-style style
                     Set status line style for windows with a bell alert.  For how to
                     specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-current-format string
                     Like window-status-format, but is the format used when the window is
                     the current window.

             window-status-current-style style
                     Set status line style for the currently active window.  For how to
                     specify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-format string
                     Set the format in which the window is displayed in the status line
                     window list.  See the status-left option for details of special
                     character sequences available.  The default is &#8216;#I:#W#F&#8217;.

             window-status-last-style style
                     Set status line style for the last active window.  For how to spec&#8208;
                     ify style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-status-separator string
                     Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status line.  The
                     default is a single space character.

             window-status-style style
                     Set status line style for a single window.  For how to specify
                     style, see the message-command-style option.

             window-style style
                     Set the default window style.  For how to specify style, see the
                     message-command-style option.

             wrap-search [on | off]
                     If this option is set, searches will wrap around the end of the pane
                     contents.  The default is on.

             xterm-keys [on | off]
                     If this option is set, tmux will generate xterm(1) -style function
                     key sequences; these have a number included to indicate modifiers
                     such as Shift, Alt or Ctrl.

     show-options [-gqsvw] [-t target-session | target-window] [option]
                   (alias: show)
             Show the window options (or a single window option if given) with -w (equiv&#8208;
             alent to show-window-options), the server options with -s, otherwise the
             session options for target session.  Global session or window options are
             listed if -g is used.  -v shows only the option value, not the name.  If -q
             is set, no error will be returned if option is unset.

     show-window-options [-gv] [-t target-window] [option]
                   (alias: showw)
             List the window options or a single option for target-window, or the global
             window options if -g is used.  -v shows only the option value, not the name.

HOOKS
     tmux allows commands to run on various triggers, called hooks.  Most tmux commands
     have an after hook and there are a number of hooks not associated with commands.

     A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as
     part of a hook itself.  They are named with an &#8216;after-&#8217; prefix.  For example, the
     following command adds a hook to select the even-vertical layout after every
     split-window:

           set-hook after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"

     All the notifications listed in the CONTROL MODE section are hooks (without any
     arguments), except %exit.  The following additional hooks are available:

     alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See monitor-activity.

     alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See monitor-bell.

     alert-silence           Run when a window has been silent.  See monitor-silence.

     client-attached         Run when a client is attached.

     client-detached         Run when a client is detached

     client-resized          Run when a client is resized.

     client-session-changed  Run when a client's attached session is changed.

     pane-died               Run when the program running in a pane exits, but
                             remain-on-exit is on so the pane has not closed.

     pane-exited             Run when the program running in a pane exits.

     pane-set-clipboard      Run when the terminal clipboard is set using the xterm(1)
                             escape sequence.

     session-created         Run when a new session created.

     session-closed          Run when a session closed.

     session-renamed         Run when a session is renamed.

     window-linked           Run when a window is linked into a session.

     window-renamed          Run when a window is renamed.

     window-unlinked         Run when a window is unlinked from a session.

     Hooks are managed with these commands:

     set-hook [-gu] [-t target-session] hook-name command
             Sets (or with -u unsets) hook hook-name to command.  If -g is given,
             hook-name is added to the global list of hooks, otherwise it is added to the
             session hooks (for target-session with -t).  Like options, session hooks
             inherit from the global ones.

     show-hooks [-g] [-t target-session]
             Shows the global list of hooks with -g, otherwise the session hooks.

MOUSE SUPPORT
     If the mouse option is on (the default is off), tmux allows mouse events to be bound
     as keys.  The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as &#8216;MouseUp1&#8217;) and
     a location suffix (one of &#8216;Pane&#8217; for the contents of a pane, &#8216;Border&#8217; for a pane
     border or &#8216;Status&#8217; for the status line).  The following mouse events are available:

           WheelUp       WheelDown
           MouseDown1    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
           MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
           MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
           DoubleClick1  DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3
           TripleClick1  TripleClick2  TripleClick3

     Each should be suffixed with a location, for example &#8216;MouseDown1Status&#8217;.

     The special token &#8216;{mouse}&#8217; or &#8216;=&#8217; may be used as target-window or target-pane in
     commands bound to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over which
     the mouse event took place (for example, the window in the status line over which
     button 1 was released for a &#8216;MouseUp1Status&#8217; binding, or the pane over which the
     wheel was scrolled for a &#8216;WheelDownPane&#8217; binding).

     The send-keys -M flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.

     The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to
     copy text and to change window using the status line.  These take effect if the
     mouse option is turned on.

FORMATS
     Certain commands accept the -F flag with a format argument.  This is a string which
     controls the output format of the command.  Replacement variables are enclosed in
     &#8216;#{&#8217; and &#8216;}&#8217;, for example &#8216;#{session_name}&#8217;.  The possible variables are listed in
     the table below, or the name of a tmux option may be used for an option's value.
     Some variables have a shorter alias such as &#8216;#S&#8217;, and &#8216;##&#8217; is replaced by a single
     &#8216;#&#8217;.

     Conditionals are available by prefixing with &#8216;?&#8217; and separating two alternatives
     with a comma; if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alterna&#8208;
     tive is chosen, otherwise the second is used.  For example
     &#8216;#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}&#8217; will include the string &#8216;attached&#8217; if
     the session is attached and the string &#8216;not attached&#8217; if it is unattached, or
     &#8216;#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}&#8217; will include &#8216;yes&#8217; if automatic-rename is enabled, or
     &#8216;no&#8217; if not.

     Comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives by &#8216;==&#8217;
     or &#8216;!=&#8217; and a colon.  For example &#8216;#{==:#{host},myhost}&#8217; will be replaced by &#8216;1&#8217; if
     running on &#8216;myhost&#8217;, otherwise by &#8216;0&#8217;.  An &#8216;m&#8217; specifies an fnmatch(3) comparison
     where the first argument is the pattern and the second the string to compare, for
     example &#8216;#{m:*foo*,#{host}}&#8217;.  &#8216;||&#8217; and &#8216;&amp;&amp;&#8217; evaluate to true if either or both of
     two comma-separated alternatives are true, for example
     &#8216;#{||,#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}&#8217;.  A &#8216;C&#8217; performs a search for an fnmatch(3)
     pattern in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number if
     found.

     A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an
     &#8216;=&#8217;, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from the start of the string and
     negative from the end, so &#8216;#{=5:pane_title}&#8217; will include at most the first 5 char&#8208;
     acters of the pane title, or &#8216;#{=-5:pane_title}&#8217; the last 5 characters.  Prefixing a
     time variable with &#8216;t:&#8217; will convert it to a string, so if &#8216;#{window_activity}&#8217;
     gives &#8216;1445765102&#8217;, &#8216;#{t:window_activity}&#8217; gives &#8216;Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015&#8217;.  The
     &#8216;b:&#8217; and &#8216;d:&#8217; prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable respectively.
     A prefix of the form &#8216;s/foo/bar/:&#8217; will substitute &#8216;foo&#8217; with &#8216;bar&#8217; throughout.

     In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using &#8216;#()&#8217;.
     For example, &#8216;#(uptime)&#8217; will insert the system's uptime.  When constructing for&#8208;
     mats, tmux does not wait for &#8216;#()&#8217; commands to finish; instead, the previous result
     from running the same command is used, or a placeholder if the command has not been
     run before.  If the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be
     used, but the status line will not be updated more than once a second.  Commands are
     executed with the tmux global environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).

     The following variables are available, where appropriate:

     Variable name          Alias    Replaced with
     alternate_on                    If pane is in alternate screen

NAMES AND TITLES
     tmux distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names, which
     may be used to specify them in targets and are displayed in the status line and var&#8208;
     ious lists: the name is the tmux identifier for a window or session.  Only panes
     have titles.  A pane's title is typically set by the program running inside the pane
     using an escape sequence (like it would set the xterm(1) window title in X(7)).
     Windows themselves do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active
     pane.  tmux itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running,
     see the set-titles option.

     A session's name is set with the new-session and rename-session commands.  A win&#8208;
     dow's name is set with one of:

     1.      A command argument (such as -n for new-window or new-session).

     2.      An escape sequence:

                   $ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'

     3.      Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the win&#8208;
             dow's active pane.  See the automatic-rename option.

     When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set
     via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:

           $ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'

     It can also be modified with the select-pane -T command.

ENVIRONMENT
     When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into the global environment;
     in addition, each session has a session environment.  When a window is created, the
     session and global environments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value
     from the session environment is used.  The result is the initial environment passed
     to the new process.

     The update-environment session option may be used to update the session environment
     from the client when a new session is created or an old reattached.  tmux also ini&#8208;
     tialises the TMUX variable with some internal information to allow commands to be
     executed from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct terminal setting of
     &#8216;screen&#8217;.

     Commands to alter and view the environment are:

     set-environment [-gru] [-t target-session] name [value]
                   (alias: setenv)
             Set or unset an environment variable.  If -g is used, the change is made in
             the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment
             for target-session.  The -u flag unsets a variable.  -r indicates the vari&#8208;
             able is to be removed from the environment before starting a new process.

     show-environment [-gs] [-t target-session] [variable]
                   (alias: showenv)
             Display the environment for target-session or the global environment with
             -g.  If variable is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed
             from the environment are prefixed with &#8216;-&#8217;.  If -s is used, the output is
             formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.

STATUS LINE
     tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each
     terminal.  By default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with the
     status session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current
     session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane in double
     quotes; and the time and date.

     The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which
     may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell command, see the
     status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and status-right-length options
     below), and a central window list.  By default, the window list shows the index,
     name and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending
     numerical order.  It may be customised with the window-status-format and
     window-status-current-format options.  The flag is one of the following symbols
     appended to the window name:

           Symbol    Meaning
           *         Denotes the current window.
           -         Marks the last window (previously selected).
           #         Window activity is monitored and activity has been detected.
           !         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
           ~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
           M         The window contains the marked pane.
           Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.

     The # symbol relates to the monitor-activity window option.  The window name is
     printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.

     The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status
     line using the status-style session option and individual windows using the
     window-status-style window option.

     The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the inter&#8208;
     val may be controlled with the status-interval session option.

     Commands related to the status line are as follows:

     command-prompt [-1i] [-I inputs] [-p prompts] [-t target-client] [template]
             Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside tmux to
             execute commands interactively.

             If template is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, -I is a
             comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If -p is given,
             prompts is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order;
             otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from template if it is
             present, or &#8216;:&#8217; if not.

             Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string &#8216;%%&#8217; and
             all occurrences of &#8216;%1&#8217; are replaced by the response to the first prompt,
             all &#8216;%2&#8217; are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for
             further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (&#8216;%1&#8217; to
             &#8216;%9&#8217;).  &#8216;%%%&#8217; is like &#8216;%%&#8217; but any quotation marks are escaped.

             -1 makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the resulting
             input is a single character.  -i executes the command every time the prompt
             input changes instead of when the user exits the command prompt.

             The following keys have a special meaning in the command prompt, depending
             on the value of the status-keys option:

                   Function                             vi        emacs
                   Cancel command prompt                Escape    Escape
                   Delete current word                            C-w

                   Delete from cursor to end            D         C-k

                   Move cursor to end                   $         C-e
                   Move cursor to next word             w         M-f
                   Move cursor to previous word         b         M-b
                   Move cursor to start                 0         C-a
                   Transpose characters                           C-t

     confirm-before [-p prompt] [-t target-client] command
                   (alias: confirm)
             Ask for confirmation before executing command.  If -p is given, prompt is
             the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from command.  It
             may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left
             option.

             This command works only from inside tmux.

     display-message [-p] [-c target-client] [-t target-pane] [message]
                   (alias: display)
             Display a message.  If -p is given, the output is printed to stdout, other&#8208;
             wise it is displayed in the target-client status line.  The format of
             message is described in the FORMATS section; information is taken from
             target-pane if -t is given, otherwise the active pane for the session
             attached to target-client.

BUFFERS
     tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers.  Each buffer may be either explicitly
     or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the
     set-buffer or load-buffer commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer
     with set-buffer -n.  Automatically named buffers are given a name such as
     &#8216;buffer0001&#8217;, &#8216;buffer0002&#8217; and so on.  When the buffer-limit option is reached, the
     oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not sub&#8208;
     ject to buffer-limit and may be deleted with delete-buffer command.

     Buffers may be added using copy-mode or the set-buffer and load-buffer commands, and
     pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command.  If a buffer command is used
     and no buffer is specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer is
     assumed.

     A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to
     2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the history-limit option (see the
     set-option command above).

     The buffer commands are as follows:

     choose-buffer [-NZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane]
             [template]
             Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from
             a list.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in buffer mode:

                   Key    Function
                   Enter  Paste selected buffer
                   Up     Select previous buffer
                   Down   Select next buffer
                   C-s    Search by name or content
                   n      Repeat last search
                   t      Toggle if buffer is tagged
                   T      Tag no buffers
                   C-t    Tag all buffers
                   p      Paste selected buffer
                   P      Paste tagged buffers
                   d      Delete selected buffer
                   D      Delete tagged buffers
                   f      Enter a format to filter items
                   O      Change sort order
                   v      Toggle preview
                   q      Exit mode

             After a buffer is chosen, &#8216;%%&#8217; is replaced by the buffer name in template
             and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "paste-buf&#8208;
             fer -b '%%'" is used.

             -O specifies the initial sort order: one of &#8216;time&#8217;, &#8216;name&#8217; or &#8216;size&#8217;.  -f
             specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to
             zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter
             would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for
             each item in the list.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works
             only if at least one client is attached.

     clear-history [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: clearhist)
             Remove and free the history for the specified pane.

     delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
                   (alias: deleteb)
             Delete the buffer named buffer-name, or the most recently added automati&#8208;
             cally named buffer if not specified.

     list-buffers [-F format]
                   (alias: lsb)
             List the global buffers.  For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS
             section.

     load-buffer [-b buffer-name] path
                   (alias: loadb)
             Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.

     paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane]
                   (alias: pasteb)
             Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not spec&#8208;
             ified, paste into the current one.  With -d, also delete the paste buffer.
             When output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced
             with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).  A custom separator may
             be specified using the -s flag.  The -r flag means to do no replacement
             (equivalent to a separator of LF).  If -p is specified, paste bracket con&#8208;
             trol codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested
             bracketed paste mode.

     save-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] path
                   (alias: saveb)
             Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path.  The -a option
             appends to rather than overwriting the file.

     set-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] [-n new-buffer-name] data
                   (alias: setb)
             Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.  The -a option appends to
             rather than overwriting the buffer.  The -n option renames the buffer to
             new-buffer-name.

     show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
                   (alias: showb)
             Display the contents of the specified buffer.

MISCELLANEOUS
     Miscellaneous commands are as follows:

     clock-mode [-t target-pane]
             Display a large clock.

     if-shell [-bF] [-t target-pane] shell-command command [command]
                   (alias: if)
             Execute the first command if shell-command returns success or the second
             command otherwise.  Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using
             the rules specified in the FORMATS section, including those relevant to
             target-pane.  With -b, shell-command is run in the background.

             If -F is given, shell-command is not executed but considered success if nei&#8208;
             ther empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).

     lock-server
                   (alias: lock)
             Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the
             lock-command option.

     run-shell [-b] [-t target-pane] shell-command
                   (alias: run)
             Execute shell-command in the background without creating a window.  Before
             being executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in the
             FORMATS section.  With -b, the command is run in the background.  After it
             finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane speci&#8208;
             fied by -t or the current pane if omitted).  If the command doesn't return
             success, the exit status is also displayed.

     wait-for [-L | -S | -U] channel
                   (alias: wait)
             When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken
             using wait-for -S with the same channel.  When -L is used, the channel is
             locked and any clients that try to lock the same channel are made to wait
             until the channel is unlocked with wait-for -U.  This command only works
             from outside tmux.

TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
     tmux understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5):

     Cs, Cr  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used
             to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default
             cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the
             cursor colour from inside tmux:

                   $ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'

     Ss, Se  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used
             to change the cursor to an underline:

                   $ printf '\033[4 q'

             If Se is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style
             instead.

     Tc      Indicate that the terminal supports the &#8216;direct colour&#8217; RGB escape sequence
             (for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).

             If supported, this is used for the OSC initialize colour escape sequence
             (which may be enabled by adding the &#8216;initc&#8217; and &#8216;ccc&#8217; capabilities to the
             tmux terminfo(5) entry).

     Ms      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See
             the set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1) man page.

CONTROL MODE
     tmux offers a textual interface called control mode.  This allows applications to
     communicate with tmux using a simple text-only protocol.

     In control mode, a client sends tmux commands or command sequences terminated by
     newlines on standard input.  Each command will produce one block of output on stan&#8208;
     dard output.  An output block consists of a %begin line followed by the output
     (which may be empty).  The output block ends with a %end or %error.  %begin and
     matching %end or %error have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch)
     and command number.  For example:

           %begin 1363006971 2
           0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
           %end 1363006971 2

     The refresh-client -C command may be used to set the size of a client in control
     mode.

     In control mode, tmux outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside
     an output block.

     The following notifications are defined:

     %client-session-changed client session-id name
             The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named
             name.

     %exit [reason]
             The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to
             any session or an error occurred.  If present, reason describes why the
             client exited.

     %layout-change window-id window-layout window-visible-layout window-flags
             The layout of a window with ID window-id changed.  The new layout is
             window-layout.  The window's visible layout is window-visible-layout and the
             window flags are window-flags.

     %output pane-id value
             A window pane produced output.  value escapes non-printable characters and
             backslash as octal \xxx.

     %pane-mode-changed pane-id
             The pane with ID pane-id has changed mode.

     "none"-changed session-id name
             The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named
             name.

     "none"-renamed name
             The current session was renamed to name.

     "none"-window-changed session-id window-id
             The session with ID session-id changed its active window to the window with
             ID window-id.

     "none"s-changed
             A session was created or destroyed.

     %unlinked-window-add window-id
             The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked to the current
             session.

     %window-add window-id
             The window with ID window-id was linked to the current session.

     %window-close window-id
             The window with ID window-id closed.

     %window-pane-changed window-id pane-id
             The active pane in the window with ID window-id changed to the pane with ID
             pane-id.

     %window-renamed window-id name
             The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.

FILES
     ~/.tmux.conf       Default tmux configuration file.
     /etc/tmux.conf     System-wide configuration file.

EXAMPLES
     To create a new tmux session running vi(1):

           $ tmux new-session vi

     Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is new:

           $ tmux new vi

     Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If there are
     several options, they are listed:

           $ tmux n
           ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window

     Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing &#8216;C-b c&#8217; (Ctrl fol&#8208;
     lowed by the &#8216;b&#8217; key followed by the &#8216;c&#8217; key).

     Windows may be navigated with: &#8216;C-b 0&#8217; (to select window 0), &#8216;C-b 1&#8217; (to select win&#8208;
     dow 1), and so on; &#8216;C-b n&#8217; to select the next window; and &#8216;C-b p&#8217; to select the pre&#8208;
     vious window.

     A session may be detached using &#8216;C-b d&#8217; (or by an external event such as ssh(1) dis&#8208;
     connection) and reattached with:

           $ tmux attach-session

     Typing &#8216;C-b ?&#8217; lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may
     be used to navigate the list or &#8216;q&#8217; to exit from it.

     Commands to be run when the tmux server is started may be placed in the ~/.tmux.conf
     configuration file.  Common examples include:

     Changing the default prefix key:

           set-option -g prefix C-a
           unbind-key C-b
           bind-key C-a send-prefix

     Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:

           set-option -g status off
           set-option -g status-style bg=blue

     Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of
     inactivity:

           set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
           set-option -g lock-after-time 1800

     Creating new key bindings:

           bind-key b set-option status
           bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
           bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
