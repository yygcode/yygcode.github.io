NAME
     tmux — terminal multiplexer
</p>

<p>
SYNOPSIS
     tmux [-2CluvV] [-c shell-command] [-f file] [-L socket-name] [-S socket-path]
          [command [flags]]
</p>

<p>
DESCRIPTION
     tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created,
     accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  tmux may be detached from a screen
     and continue running in the background, then later reattached.
</p>

<p>
When tmux is started it creates a new session with a single window and displays it
on screen.  A status line at the bottom of the screen shows information on the cur‐
rent session and is used to enter interactive commands.
</p>

<p>
A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux.
Each session has one or more windows linked to it.  A window occupies the entire
screen and may be split into rectangular panes, each of which is a separate pseudo
terminal (the pty(4) manual page documents the technical details of pseudo termi‐
nals).  Any number of tmux instances may connect to the same session, and any number
of windows may be present in the same session.  Once all sessions are killed, tmux
exits.
</p>

<p>
Each session is persistent and will survive accidental disconnection (such as ssh(1)
connection timeout) or intentional detaching (with the ‘C-b d’ key strokes).  tmux
may be reattached using:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux attach
</p>

<p>
In tmux, a session is displayed on screen by a client and all sessions are managed
by a single server.  The server and each client are separate processes which commu‐
nicate through a socket in /tmp.
</p>

<p>
The options are as follows:
</p>

<p>
-2            Force tmux to assume the terminal supports 256 colours.
</p>

<p>
-C            Start in control mode (see the CONTROL MODE section).  Given twice
	      (-CC) disables echo.
</p>

<p>
-c shell-command
	      Execute shell-command using the default shell.  If necessary, the tmux
	      server will be started to retrieve the default-shell option.  This
	      option is for compatibility with sh(1) when tmux is used as a login
	      shell.
</p>

<p>
-f file       Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, tmux loads the
	      system configuration file from <i>etc/tmux.conf, if present, then looks
	      for a user configuration file at ~</i>.tmux.conf.
</p>

<p>
The configuration file is a set of tmux commands which are executed in
sequence when the server is first started.  tmux loads configuration
files once when the server process has started.  The source-file com‐
mand may be used to load a file later.
</p>

<p>
tmux shows any error messages from commands in configuration files in
the first session created, and continues to process the rest of the
configuration file.
</p>

<p>
-L socket-name
	      tmux stores the server socket in a directory under TMUX_TMPDIR or /tmp
	      if it is unset.  The default socket is named default.  This option
	      allows a different socket name to be specified, allowing several inde‐
	      pendent tmux servers to be run.  Unlike -S a full path is not neces‐
	      sary: the sockets are all created in the same directory.
</p>

<p>
If the socket is accidentally removed, the SIGUSR1 signal may be sent
to the tmux server process to recreate it (note that this will fail if
any parent directories are missing).
</p>

<p>
-l            Behave as a login shell.  This flag currently has no effect and is for
	      compatibility with other shells when using tmux as a login shell.
</p>

<p>
-S socket-path
	      Specify a full alternative path to the server socket.  If -S is speci‐
	      fied, the default socket directory is not used and any -L flag is
	      ignored.
</p>

<p>
-u            When starting, tmux looks for the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and LANG environ‐
	      ment variables: if the first found contains ‘UTF-8’, then the terminal
	      is assumed to support UTF-8.  This is not always correct: the -u flag
	      explicitly informs tmux that UTF-8 is supported.
</p>

<p>
Note that tmux itself always accepts UTF-8; this controls whether it
will send UTF-8 characters to the terminal it is running (if not, they
are replaced by ‘_’).
</p>

<p>
-v            Request verbose logging.  Log messages will be saved into
	      tmux-client-PID.log and tmux-server-PID.log files in the current
	      directory, where PID is the PID of the server or client process.  If
	      -v is specified twice, an additional tmux-out-PID.log file is gener‐
	      ated with a copy of everything tmux writes to the terminal.
</p>

<p>
The SIGUSR2 signal may be sent to the tmux server process to toggle
logging between on (as if -v was given) and off.
</p>

<p>
-V            Report the tmux version.
</p>

<p>
command [flags]
	      This specifies one of a set of commands used to control tmux, as
	      described in the following sections.  If no commands are specified,
	      the new-session command is assumed.
</p>

<p>
KEY BINDINGS
     tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a pre‐
     fix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by default, followed by a command key.
</p>

<p>
The default command key bindings are:
</p>

<p>
C-b         Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.
C-o         Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
C-z         Suspend the tmux client.
!           Break the current pane out of the window.
"           Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
</p>

<p>
$           Rename the current session.
%           Split the current pane into two, left and right.
&amp;           Kill the current window.
'           Prompt for a window index to select.
(           Switch the attached client to the previous session.
)           Switch the attached client to the next session.
,           Rename the current window.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

COMMANDS
     This section contains a list of the commands supported by tmux.  Most commands
     accept the optional -t (and sometimes -s) argument with one of target-client,
     target-session target-window, or target-pane.  These specify the client, session,
     window or pane which a command should affect.
</p>

<p>
target-client should be the name of the client, typically the pty(4) file to which
the client is connected, for example either of /dev/ttyp1 or ttyp1 for the client
attached to /dev/ttyp1.  If no client is specified, tmux attempts to work out the
client currently in use; if that fails, an error is reported.  Clients may be listed
with the list-clients command.
</p>

<p>
target-session is tried as, in order:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A session ID prefixed with a $.</li>

<li>An exact name of a session (as listed by the list-sessions command).</li>

<li>The start of a session name, for example ‘mysess’ would match a session
named ‘mysession’.</li>

<li>An fnmatch(3) pattern which is matched against the session name.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If the session name is prefixed with an ‘=’, only an exact match is accepted (so
‘=mysess’ will only match exactly ‘mysess’, not ‘mysession’).
</p>

<p>
If a single session is found, it is used as the target session; multiple matches
produce an error.  If a session is omitted, the current session is used if avail‐
able; if no current session is available, the most recently used is chosen.
</p>

<p>
target-window (or src-window or dst-window) specifies a window in the form
session:window.  session follows the same rules as for target-session, and window is
looked for in order as:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A special token, listed below.</li>

<li>A window index, for example ‘mysession:1’ is window 1 in session
‘mysession’.</li>

<li>A window ID, such as @1.</li>

<li>An exact window name, such as ‘mysession:mywindow’.</li>

<li>The start of a window name, such as ‘mysession:mywin’.</li>

<li>As an fnmatch(3) pattern matched against the window name.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Like sessions, a ‘=’ prefix will do an exact match only.  An empty window name spec‐
ifies the next unused index if appropriate (for example the new-window and
link-window commands) otherwise the current window in session is chosen.
</p>

<p>
The following special tokens are available to indicate particular windows.  Each has
a single-character alternative form.
</p>

<p>
Token              Meaning
{start}       ^    The lowest-numbered window
{end}         $    The highest-numbered window
{last}        !    The last (previously current) window
{next}        +    The next window by number
{previous}    -    The previous window by number
</p>

<p>
target-pane (or src-pane or dst-pane) may be a pane ID or takes a similar form to
target-window but with the optional addition of a period followed by a pane index or
pane ID, for example: ‘mysession:mywindow.1’.  If the pane index is omitted, the
currently active pane in the specified window is used.  The following special tokens
are available for the pane index:
</p>

<p>
Token                  Meaning
{last}            !    The last (previously active) pane
{next}            +    The next pane by number
{previous}        -    The previous pane by number
{top}                  The top pane
{bottom}               The bottom pane
{left}                 The leftmost pane
{right}                The rightmost pane
{top-left}             The top-left pane
{top-right}            The top-right pane
{bottom-left}          The bottom-left pane
{bottom-right}         The bottom-right pane
{up-of}                The pane above the active pane
{down-of}              The pane below the active pane
{left-of}              The pane to the left of the active pane
{right-of}             The pane to the right of the active pane
</p>

<p>
The tokens ‘+’ and ‘-’ may be followed by an offset, for example:
</p>

<p>
select-window -t:+2
</p>

<p>
In addition, target-session, target-window or target-pane may consist entirely of
the token ‘{mouse}’ (alternative form ‘=’) to specify the most recent mouse event
(see the MOUSE SUPPORT section) or ‘{marked}’ (alternative form ‘~’) to specify the
marked pane (see select-pane -m).
</p>

<p>
Sessions, window and panes are each numbered with a unique ID; session IDs are pre‐
fixed with a ‘$’, windows with a ‘@’, and panes with a ‘%’.  These are unique and
are unchanged for the life of the session, window or pane in the tmux server.  The
pane ID is passed to the child process of the pane in the TMUX_PANE environment
variable.  IDs may be displayed using the ‘session_id’, ‘window_id’, or ‘pane_id’
formats (see the FORMATS section) and the display-message, list-sessions,
list-windows or list-panes commands.
</p>

<p>
shell-command arguments are sh(1) commands.  This may be a single argument passed to
the shell, for example:
</p>

<p>
new-window 'vi /etc/passwd'
</p>

<p>
Will run:
</p>

<p>
/bin/sh -c 'vi /etc/passwd'
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the new-window, new-session, split-window, respawn-window and
respawn-pane commands allow shell-command to be given as multiple arguments and exe‐
cuted directly (without ‘sh -c’).  This can avoid issues with shell quoting.  For
example:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux new-window vi /etc/passwd
</p>

<p>
Will run vi(1) directly without invoking the shell.
</p>

<p>
command [arguments] refers to a tmux command, passed with the command and arguments
separately, for example:
</p>

<p>
bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81
</p>

<p>
Or if using sh(1):
</p>

<p>
$ tmux bind-key F1 set-window-option force-width 81
</p>

<p>
Multiple commands may be specified together as part of a command sequence.  Each
command should be separated by spaces and a semicolon; commands are executed sequen‐
tially from left to right and lines ending with a backslash continue on to the next
line, except when escaped by another backslash.  A literal semicolon may be included
by escaping it with a backslash (for example, when specifying a command sequence to
bind-key).
</p>

<p>
Example tmux commands include:
</p>

<p>
refresh-client -t/dev/ttyp2
</p>

<p>
rename-session -tfirst newname
</p>

<p>
set-window-option -t:0 monitor-activity on
</p>

<p>
new-window ; split-window -d
</p>

<p>
bind-key R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; \
	display-message "source-file done"
</p>

<p>
Or from sh(1):
</p>

<p>
$ tmux kill-window -t :1
</p>

<p>
$ tmux new-window \; split-window -d
</p>

<p>
$ tmux new-session -d 'vi /etc/passwd' \; split-window -d \; attach
</p>

<p>
CLIENTS AND SESSIONS
     The tmux server manages clients, sessions, windows and panes.  Clients are attached
     to sessions to interact with them, either when they are created with the new-session
     command, or later with the attach-session command.  Each session has one or more
     windows linked into it.  Windows may be linked to multiple sessions and are made up
     of one or more panes, each of which contains a pseudo terminal.  Commands for creat‐
     ing, linking and otherwise manipulating windows are covered in the WINDOWS AND PANES
     section.
</p>

<p>
The following commands are available to manage clients and sessions:
</p>

<p>
attach-session [-dEr] [-c working-directory] [-t target-session]
	      (alias: attach)
	If run from outside tmux, create a new client in the current terminal and
	attach it to target-session.  If used from inside, switch the current
	client.  If -d is specified, any other clients attached to the session are
	detached.  -r signifies the client is read-only (only keys bound to the
	detach-client or switch-client commands have any effect)
</p>

<p>
If no server is started, attach-session will attempt to start it; this will
fail unless sessions are created in the configuration file.
</p>

<p>
The target-session rules for attach-session are slightly adjusted: if tmux
needs to select the most recently used session, it will prefer the most
recently used unattached session.
</p>

<p>
-c will set the session working directory (used for new windows) to
working-directory.
</p>

<p>
If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.
</p>

<p>
detach-client [-aP] [-E shell-command] [-s target-session] [-t target-client]
	      (alias: detach)
	Detach the current client if bound to a key, the client specified with -t,
	or all clients currently attached to the session specified by -s.  The -a
	option kills all but the client given with -t.  If -P is given, send SIGHUP
	to the parent process of the client, typically causing it to exit.  With -E,
	run shell-command to replace the client.
</p>

<p>
has-session [-t target-session]
	      (alias: has)
	Report an error and exit with 1 if the specified session does not exist.  If
	it does exist, exit with 0.
</p>

<p>
kill-server
	Kill the tmux server and clients and destroy all sessions.
</p>

<p>
kill-session [-aC] [-t target-session]
	Destroy the given session, closing any windows linked to it and no other
	sessions, and detaching all clients attached to it.  If -a is given, all
	sessions but the specified one is killed.  The -C flag clears alerts (bell,
	activity, or silence) in all windows linked to the session.
</p>

<p>
list-clients [-F format] [-t target-session]
	      (alias: lsc)
	List all clients attached to the server.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
	see the FORMATS section.  If target-session is specified, list only clients
	connected to that session.
</p>

<p>
list-commands [-F format]
	      (alias: lscm)
	List the syntax of all commands supported by tmux.
</p>

<p>
list-sessions [-F format]
	      (alias: ls)
	List all sessions managed by the server.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
	see the FORMATS section.
</p>

<p>
lock-client [-t target-client]
	      (alias: lockc)
	Lock target-client, see the lock-server command.
</p>

<p>
lock-session [-t target-session]
	      (alias: locks)
	Lock all clients attached to target-session.
</p>

<p>
new-session [-AdDEP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s
	session-name] [-t group-name] [-x width] [-y height] [shell-command]
	      (alias: new)
	Create a new session with name session-name.
</p>

<p>
The new session is attached to the current terminal unless -d is given.
window-name and shell-command are the name of and shell command to execute
in the initial window.  With -d, the initial size is 80 x 24; -x and -y can
be used to specify a different size.
</p>

<p>
If run from a terminal, any termios(4) special characters are saved and used
for new windows in the new session.
</p>

<p>
The -A flag makes new-session behave like attach-session if session-name
already exists; in this case, -D behaves like -d to attach-session.
</p>

<p>
If -t is given, it specifies a session group.  Sessions in the same group
share the same set of windows - new windows are linked to all sessions in
the group and any windows closed removed from all sessions.  The current and
previous window and any session options remain independent and any session
in a group may be killed without affecting the others.  The group-name argu‐
ment may be:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>the name of an existing group, in which case the new session is
added to that group;</li>

<li>the name of an existing session - the new session is added to the
same group as that session, creating a new group if necessary;</li>

<li>the name for a new group containing only the new session.</li>
</ol>

<p>
-n and shell-command are invalid if -t is used.
</p>

<p>
The -P option prints information about the new session after it has been
created.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:’ but a different
format may be specified with -F.
</p>

<p>
If -E is used, the update-environment option will not be applied.
</p>

<p>
refresh-client [-C width,height] [-S] [-t target-client]
	      (alias: refresh)
	Refresh the current client if bound to a key, or a single client if one is
	given with -t.  If -S is specified, only update the client's status line.
</p>

<p>
-C sets the width and height of a control client.
</p>

<p>
rename-session [-t target-session] new-name
	      (alias: rename)
	Rename the session to new-name.
</p>

<p>
show-messages [-JT] [-t target-client]
	      (alias: showmsgs)
	Show client messages or server information.  Any messages displayed on the
	status line are saved in a per-client message log, up to a maximum of the
	limit set by the message-limit server option.  With -t, display the log for
	target-client.  -J and -T show debugging information about jobs and termi‐
	nals.
</p>

<p>
source-file [-q] path
	      (alias: source)
	Execute commands from path (which may be a glob(3) pattern).  If -q is
	given, no error will be returned if path does not exist.
</p>

<p>
Within a configuration file, commands may be made conditional by surrounding
them with %if and %endif lines.  Additional %elif and %else lines may also
be used.  The argument to %if and %elif is expanded as a format and if it
evaluates to false (zero or empty), subsequent lines are ignored until the
next %elif, %else or %endif.  For example:
</p>

<p>
%if #{==:#{host},myhost}
set -g status-style bg=red
%elif #{==:#{host},myotherhost}
set -g status-style bg=green
%else
set -g status-style bg=blue
%endif
</p>

<p>
Will change the status line to red if running on ‘myhost’, green if running
on ‘myotherhost’, or blue if running on another host.
</p>

<p>
start-server
	      (alias: start)
	Start the tmux server, if not already running, without creating any ses‐
	sions.
</p>

<p>
suspend-client [-t target-client]
	      (alias: suspendc)
	Suspend a client by sending SIGTSTP (tty stop).
</p>

<p>
switch-client [-Elnpr] [-c target-client] [-t target-session] [-T key-table]
	      (alias: switchc)
	Switch the current session for client target-client to target-session.  If
	-l, -n or -p is used, the client is moved to the last, next or previous ses‐
	sion respectively.  -r toggles whether a client is read-only (see the
	attach-session command).
</p>

<p>
If -E is used, update-environment option will not be applied.
</p>

<p>
-T sets the client's key table; the next key from the client will be inter‐
preted from key-table.  This may be used to configure multiple prefix keys,
or to bind commands to sequences of keys.  For example, to make typing ‘abc’
run the list-keys command:
</p>

<p>
bind-key -Ttable2 c list-keys
bind-key -Ttable1 b switch-client -Ttable2
bind-key -Troot   a switch-client -Ttable1
</p>

<p>
WINDOWS AND PANES
     A tmux window may be in one of two modes.  The default permits direct access to the
     terminal attached to the window.  The other is copy mode, which permits a section of
     a window or its history to be copied to a paste buffer for later insertion into
     another window.  This mode is entered with the copy-mode command, bound to ‘[’ by
     default.  It is also entered when a command that produces output, such as list-keys,
     is executed from a key binding.
</p>

<p>
Commands are sent to copy mode using the -X flag to the send-keys command.  When a
key is pressed, copy mode automatically uses one of two key tables, depending on the
mode-keys option: copy-mode for emacs, or copy-mode-vi for vi.  Key tables may be
viewed with the list-keys command.
</p>

<p>
The following commands are supported in copy mode:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
The ‘-and-cancel’ variants of some commands exit copy mode after they have completed
(for copy commands) or when the cursor reaches the bottom (for scrolling commands).
</p>

<p>
The next and previous word keys use space and the ‘-’, ‘_’ and ‘@’ characters as
word delimiters by default, but this can be adjusted by setting the word-separators
session option.  Next word moves to the start of the next word, next word end to the
end of the next word and previous word to the start of the previous word.  The three
next and previous space keys work similarly but use a space alone as the word sepa‐
rator.
</p>

<p>
The jump commands enable quick movement within a line.  For instance, typing ‘f’
followed by ‘/’ will move the cursor to the next ‘/’ character on the current line.
A ‘;’ will then jump to the next occurrence.
</p>

<p>
Commands in copy mode may be prefaced by an optional repeat count.  With vi key
bindings, a prefix is entered using the number keys; with emacs, the Alt (meta) key
and a number begins prefix entry.
</p>

<p>
The synopsis for the copy-mode command is:
</p>

<p>
copy-mode [-Meu] [-t target-pane]
	Enter copy mode.  The -u option scrolls one page up.  -M begins a mouse drag
	(only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see MOUSE SUPPORT).  -e speci‐
	fies that scrolling to the bottom of the history (to the visible screen)
	should exit copy mode.  While in copy mode, pressing a key other than those
	used for scrolling will disable this behaviour.  This is intended to allow
	fast scrolling through a pane's history, for example with:
</p>

<p>
bind PageUp copy-mode -eu
</p>

<p>
Each window displayed by tmux may be split into one or more panes; each pane takes
up a certain area of the display and is a separate terminal.  A window may be split
into panes using the split-window command.  Windows may be split horizontally (with
the -h flag) or vertically.  Panes may be resized with the resize-pane command
(bound to ‘C-Up’, ‘C-Down’ ‘C-Left’ and ‘C-Right’ by default), the current pane may
be changed with the select-pane command and the rotate-window and swap-pane commands
may be used to swap panes without changing their position.  Panes are numbered
beginning from zero in the order they are created.
</p>

<p>
A number of preset layouts are available.  These may be selected with the
select-layout command or cycled with next-layout (bound to ‘Space’ by default); once
a layout is chosen, panes within it may be moved and resized as normal.
</p>

<p>
The following layouts are supported:
</p>

<p>
even-horizontal
	Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.
</p>

<p>
even-vertical
	Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.
</p>

<p>
main-horizontal
	A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining
	panes are spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.
	Use the main-pane-height window option to specify the height of the top
	pane.
</p>

<p>
main-vertical
	Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the left and the
	others spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the main-pane-width
	window option.
</p>

<p>
tiled   Panes are spread out as evenly as possible over the window in both rows and
	columns.
</p>

<p>
In addition, select-layout may be used to apply a previously used layout - the
list-windows command displays the layout of each window in a form suitable for use
with select-layout.  For example:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux list-windows
0: ksh [159x48]
    layout: bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
$ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}
</p>

<p>
tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window size.  Note
that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes than that from which the
layout was originally defined.
</p>

<p>
Commands related to windows and panes are as follows:
</p>

<p>
break-pane [-dP] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-window]
	      (alias: breakp)
	Break src-pane off from its containing window to make it the only pane in
	dst-window.  If -d is given, the new window does not become the current win‐
	dow.  The -P option prints information about the new window after it has
	been created.  By default, it uses the format
	‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but a different format may be specified
	with -F.
</p>

<p>
capture-pane [-aepPqCJ] [-b buffer-name] [-E end-line] [-S start-line] [-t
	target-pane]
	      (alias: capturep)
	Capture the contents of a pane.  If -p is given, the output goes to stdout,
	otherwise to the buffer specified with -b or a new buffer if omitted.  If -a
	is given, the alternate screen is used, and the history is not accessible.
	If no alternate screen exists, an error will be returned unless -q is given.
	If -e is given, the output includes escape sequences for text and background
	attributes.  -C also escapes non-printable characters as octal \xxx.  -J
	joins wrapped lines and preserves trailing spaces at each line's end.  -P
	captures only any output that the pane has received that is the beginning of
	an as-yet incomplete escape sequence.
</p>

<p>
-S and -E specify the starting and ending line numbers, zero is the first
line of the visible pane and negative numbers are lines in the history.  ‘-’
to -S is the start of the history and to -E the end of the visible pane.
The default is to capture only the visible contents of the pane.
</p>

<p>
choose-client [-NZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane]
	[template]
	Put a pane into client mode, allowing a client to be selected interactively
	from a list.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in client
	mode:
</p>

<p>
Key    Function
Enter  Choose selected client
Up     Select previous client
Down   Select next client
C-s    Search by name
n      Repeat last search
t      Toggle if client is tagged
T      Tag no clients
C-t    Tag all clients
d      Detach selected client
D      Detach tagged clients
x      Detach and HUP selected client
X      Detach and HUP tagged clients
z      Suspend selected client
Z      Suspend tagged clients
f      Enter a format to filter items
O      Change sort order
v      Toggle preview
q      Exit mode
</p>

<p>
After a client is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the client name in template
and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "detach-
client -t '%%'" is used.
</p>

<p>
-O specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘name’, ‘size’, ‘creation’, or
‘activity’.  -f specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it
evaluates to zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.
If a filter would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the
format for each item in the list.  -N starts without the preview.  This com‐
mand works only if at least one client is attached.
</p>

<p>
choose-tree [-GNswZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane]
	[template]
	Put a pane into tree mode, where a session, window or pane may be chosen
	interactively from a list.  -s starts with sessions collapsed and -w with
	windows collapsed.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in
	tree mode:
</p>

<p>
Key    Function
Enter  Choose selected item
Up     Select previous item
Down   Select next item
&lt;      Scroll list of previews left
&gt;      Scroll list of previews right
C-s    Search by name
n      Repeat last search
t      Toggle if item is tagged
T      Tag no items
C-t    Tag all items
</p>
<pre class="example">
Run a command for each tagged item

</pre>
<p>
f      Enter a format to filter items
O      Change sort order
v      Toggle preview
q      Exit mode
</p>

<p>
After a session, window or pane is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the target in
template and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given,
"switch-client -t '%%'" is used.
</p>

<p>
-O specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘index’, ‘name’, or ‘time’.  -f
specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to
zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter
would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for
each item in the tree.  -N starts without the preview.  -G includes all ses‐
sions in any session groups in the tree rather than only the first.  This
command works only if at least one client is attached.
</p>

<p>
display-panes [-d duration] [-t target-client] [template]
	      (alias: displayp)
	Display a visible indicator of each pane shown by target-client.  See the
	display-panes-colour and display-panes-active-colour session options.  The
	indicator is closed when a key is pressed or duration milliseconds have
	passed.  If -d is not given, display-panes-time is used.  A duration of zero
	means the indicator stays until a key is pressed.  While the indicator is on
	screen, a pane may be chosen with the ‘0’ to ‘9’ keys, which will cause
	template to be executed as a command with ‘%%’ substituted by the pane ID.
	The default template is "select-pane -t '%%'".
</p>

<p>
find-window [-CNT] [-t target-pane] match-string
	      (alias: findw)
	Search for the fnmatch(3) pattern match-string in window names, titles, and
	visible content (but not history).  The flags control matching behavior: -C
	matches only visible window contents, -N matches only the window name and -T
	matches only the window title.  The default is -CNT.
</p>

<p>
This command works only if at least one client is attached.
</p>

<p>
join-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
	      (alias: joinp)
	Like split-window, but instead of splitting dst-pane and creating a new
	pane, split it and move src-pane into the space.  This can be used to
	reverse break-pane.  The -b option causes src-pane to be joined to left of
	or above dst-pane.
</p>

<p>
If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the
marked pane is used rather than the current pane.
</p>

<p>
kill-pane [-a] [-t target-pane]
	      (alias: killp)
	Destroy the given pane.  If no panes remain in the containing window, it is
	also destroyed.  The -a option kills all but the pane given with -t.
</p>

<p>
kill-window [-a] [-t target-window]
	      (alias: killw)
	Kill the current window or the window at target-window, removing it from any
	sessions to which it is linked.  The -a option kills all but the window
	given with -t.
</p>

<p>
last-pane [-de] [-t target-window]
	      (alias: lastp)
	Select the last (previously selected) pane.  -e enables or -d disables input
	to the pane.
</p>

<p>
last-window [-t target-session]
	      (alias: last)
	Select the last (previously selected) window.  If no target-session is spec‐
	ified, select the last window of the current session.
</p>

<p>
link-window [-adk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
	      (alias: linkw)
	Link the window at src-window to the specified dst-window.  If dst-window is
	specified and no such window exists, the src-window is linked there.  With
	-a, the window is moved to the next index up (following windows are moved if
	necessary).  If -k is given and dst-window exists, it is killed, otherwise
	an error is generated.  If -d is given, the newly linked window is not
	selected.
</p>

<p>
list-panes [-as] [-F format] [-t target]
	      (alias: lsp)
	If -a is given, target is ignored and all panes on the server are listed.
	If -s is given, target is a session (or the current session).  If neither is
	given, target is a window (or the current window).  For the meaning of the
	-F flag, see the FORMATS section.
</p>

<p>
list-windows [-a] [-F format] [-t target-session]
	      (alias: lsw)
	If -a is given, list all windows on the server.  Otherwise, list windows in
	the current session or in target-session.  For the meaning of the -F flag,
	see the FORMATS section.
</p>

<p>
move-pane [-bdhv] [-l size | -p percentage] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
	      (alias: movep)
	Like join-pane, but src-pane and dst-pane may belong to the same window.
</p>

<p>
move-window [-ardk] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
	      (alias: movew)
	This is similar to link-window, except the window at src-window is moved to
	dst-window.  With -r, all windows in the session are renumbered in sequen‐
	tial order, respecting the base-index option.
</p>

<p>
new-window [-adkP] [-c start-directory] [-F format] [-n window-name] [-t
	target-window] [shell-command]
	      (alias: neww)
	Create a new window.  With -a, the new window is inserted at the next index
	up from the specified target-window, moving windows up if necessary, other‐
	wise target-window is the new window location.
</p>

<p>
If -d is given, the session does not make the new window the current window.
target-window represents the window to be created; if the target already
exists an error is shown, unless the -k flag is used, in which case it is
destroyed.  shell-command is the command to execute.  If shell-command is
not specified, the value of the default-command option is used.  -c speci‐
fies the working directory in which the new window is created.
</p>

<p>
When the shell command completes, the window closes.  See the remain-on-exit
option to change this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
The TERM environment variable must be set to ‘screen’ or ‘tmux’ for all pro‐
grams running inside tmux.  New windows will automatically have
‘TERM=screen’ added to their environment, but care must be taken not to
reset this in shell start-up files.
</p>

<p>
The -P option prints information about the new window after it has been cre‐
ated.  By default, it uses the format ‘#{session_name}:#{window_index}’ but
a different format may be specified with -F.
</p>

<p>
next-layout [-t target-window]
	      (alias: nextl)
	Move a window to the next layout and rearrange the panes to fit.
</p>

<p>
next-window [-a] [-t target-session]
	      (alias: next)
	Move to the next window in the session.  If -a is used, move to the next
	window with an alert.
</p>

<p>
pipe-pane [-IOo] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
	      (alias: pipep)
	Pipe output sent by the program in target-pane to a shell command or vice
	versa.  A pane may only be connected to one command at a time, any existing
	pipe is closed before shell-command is executed.  The shell-command string
	may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left
	option.  If no shell-command is given, the current pipe (if any) is closed.
</p>

<p>
-I and -O specify which of the shell-command output streams are connected to
the pane: with -I stdout is connected (so anything shell-command prints is
written to the pane as if it were typed); with -O stdin is connected (so any
output in the pane is piped to shell-command).  Both may be used together
and if neither are specified, -O is used.
</p>

<p>
The -o option only opens a new pipe if no previous pipe exists, allowing a
pipe to be toggled with a single key, for example:
</p>

<p>
bind-key C-p pipe-pane -o 'cat &gt;&gt;~/output.#I-#P'
</p>

<p>
previous-layout [-t target-window]
	      (alias: prevl)
	Move to the previous layout in the session.
</p>

<p>
previous-window [-a] [-t target-session]
	      (alias: prev)
	Move to the previous window in the session.  With -a, move to the previous
	window with an alert.
</p>

<p>
rename-window [-t target-window] new-name
	      (alias: renamew)
	Rename the current window, or the window at target-window if specified, to
	new-name.
</p>

<p>
resize-pane [-DLMRUZ] [-t target-pane] [-x width] [-y height] [adjustment]
	      (alias: resizep)
	Resize a pane, up, down, left or right by adjustment with -U, -D, -L or -R,
	or to an absolute size with -x or -y.  The adjustment is given in lines or
	cells (the default is 1).
</p>

<p>
With -Z, the active pane is toggled between zoomed (occupying the whole of
the window) and unzoomed (its normal position in the layout).
</p>

<p>
-M begins mouse resizing (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding, see
MOUSE SUPPORT).
</p>

<p>
respawn-pane [-c start-directory] [-k] [-t target-pane] [shell-command]
	      (alias: respawnp)
	Reactivate a pane in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit
	window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the
	pane was created is executed.  The pane must be already inactive, unless -k
	is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a new
	working directory for the pane.
</p>

<p>
respawn-window [-c start-directory] [-k] [-t target-window] [shell-command]
	      (alias: respawnw)
	Reactivate a window in which the command has exited (see the remain-on-exit
	window option).  If shell-command is not given, the command used when the
	window was created is executed.  The window must be already inactive, unless
	-k is given, in which case any existing command is killed.  -c specifies a
	new working directory for the window.
</p>

<p>
rotate-window [-DU] [-t target-window]
	      (alias: rotatew)
	Rotate the positions of the panes within a window, either upward (numeri‐
	cally lower) with -U or downward (numerically higher).
</p>

<p>
select-layout [-Enop] [-t target-pane] [layout-name]
	      (alias: selectl)
	Choose a specific layout for a window.  If layout-name is not given, the
	last preset layout used (if any) is reapplied.  -n and -p are equivalent to
	the next-layout and previous-layout commands.  -o applies the last set lay‐
	out if possible (undoes the most recent layout change).  -E spreads the cur‐
	rent pane and any panes next to it out evenly.
</p>

<p>
select-pane [-DdegLlMmRU] [-P style] [-T title] [-t target-pane]
	      (alias: selectp)
	Make pane target-pane the active pane in window target-window, or set its
	style (with -P).  If one of -D, -L, -R, or -U is used, respectively the pane
	below, to the left, to the right, or above the target pane is used.  -l is
	the same as using the last-pane command.  -e enables or -d disables input to
	the pane.
</p>

<p>
-m and -M are used to set and clear the marked pane.  There is one marked
pane at a time, setting a new marked pane clears the last.  The marked pane
is the default target for -s to join-pane, swap-pane and swap-window.
</p>

<p>
Each pane has a style: by default the window-style and window-active-style
options are used, select-pane -P sets the style for a single pane.  For
example, to set the pane 1 background to red:
</p>

<p>
select-pane -t:.1 -P 'bg=red'
</p>

<p>
-g shows the current pane style.
</p>

<p>
-T sets the pane title.
</p>

<p>
select-window [-lnpT] [-t target-window]
	      (alias: selectw)
	Select the window at target-window.  -l, -n and -p are equivalent to the
	last-window, next-window and previous-window commands.  If -T is given and
	the selected window is already the current window, the command behaves like
	last-window.
</p>

<p>
split-window [-bdfhvP] [-c start-directory] [-l size | -p percentage] [-t
	target-pane] [shell-command] [-F format]
	      (alias: splitw)
	Create a new pane by splitting target-pane: -h does a horizontal split and
	-v a vertical split; if neither is specified, -v is assumed.  The -l and -p
	options specify the size of the new pane in lines (for vertical split) or in
	cells (for horizontal split), or as a percentage, respectively.  The -b
	option causes the new pane to be created to the left of or above
	target-pane.  The -f option creates a new pane spanning the full window
	height (with -h) or full window width (with -v), instead of splitting the
	active pane.  All other options have the same meaning as for the new-window
	command.
</p>

<p>
swap-pane [-dDU] [-s src-pane] [-t dst-pane]
	      (alias: swapp)
	Swap two panes.  If -U is used and no source pane is specified with -s,
	dst-pane is swapped with the previous pane (before it numerically); -D swaps
	with the next pane (after it numerically).  -d instructs tmux not to change
	the active pane.
</p>

<p>
If -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see select-pane -m), the
marked pane is used rather than the current pane.
</p>

<p>
swap-window [-d] [-s src-window] [-t dst-window]
	      (alias: swapw)
	This is similar to link-window, except the source and destination windows
	are swapped.  It is an error if no window exists at src-window.
</p>

<p>
Like swap-pane, if -s is omitted and a marked pane is present (see
select-pane -m), the window containing the marked pane is used rather than
the current window.
</p>

<p>
unlink-window [-k] [-t target-window]
	      (alias: unlinkw)
	Unlink target-window.  Unless -k is given, a window may be unlinked only if
	it is linked to multiple sessions - windows may not be linked to no ses‐
	sions; if -k is specified and the window is linked to only one session, it
	is unlinked and destroyed.
</p>

<p>
KEY BINDINGS
     tmux allows a command to be bound to most keys, with or without a prefix key.  When
     specifying keys, most represent themselves (for example ‘A’ to ‘Z’).  Ctrl keys may
     be prefixed with ‘C-’ or ‘^’, and Alt (meta) with ‘M-’.  In addition, the following
     special key names are accepted: Up, Down, Left, Right, BSpace, BTab, DC (Delete),
     End, Enter, Escape, F1 to F12, Home, IC (Insert), NPage/PageDown/PgDn,
     PPage/PageUp/PgUp, Space, and Tab.  Note that to bind the ‘"’ or ‘'’ keys, quotation
     marks are necessary, for example:
</p>

<p>
bind-key '"' split-window
bind-key "'" new-window
</p>

<p>
Commands related to key bindings are as follows:
</p>

<p>
bind-key [-nr] [-T key-table] key command [arguments]
	      (alias: bind)
	Bind key key to command.  Keys are bound in a key table.  By default (with‐
	out -T), the key is bound in the prefix key table.  This table is used for
	keys pressed after the prefix key (for example, by default ‘c’ is bound to
	new-window in the prefix table, so ‘C-b c’ creates a new window).  The root
	table is used for keys pressed without the prefix key: binding ‘c’ to
	new-window in the root table (not recommended) means a plain ‘c’ will create
	a new window.  -n is an alias for -T root.  Keys may also be bound in custom
	key tables and the switch-client -T command used to switch to them from a
	key binding.  The -r flag indicates this key may repeat, see the repeat-time
	option.
</p>

<p>
To view the default bindings and possible commands, see the list-keys com‐
mand.
</p>

<p>
list-keys [-T key-table]
	      (alias: lsk)
	List all key bindings.  Without -T all key tables are printed.  With -T only
	key-table.
</p>

<p>
send-keys [-lMRX] [-N repeat-count] [-t target-pane] key &#x2026;
	      (alias: send)
	Send a key or keys to a window.  Each argument key is the name of the key
	(such as ‘C-a’ or ‘NPage’) to send; if the string is not recognised as a
	key, it is sent as a series of characters.  The -l flag disables key name
	lookup and sends the keys literally.  All arguments are sent sequentially
	from first to last.  The -R flag causes the terminal state to be reset.
</p>

<p>
-M passes through a mouse event (only valid if bound to a mouse key binding,
see MOUSE SUPPORT).
</p>

<p>
-X is used to send a command into copy mode - see the WINDOWS AND PANES sec‐
tion.  -N specifies a repeat count.
</p>

<p>
send-prefix [-2] [-t target-pane]
	Send the prefix key, or with -2 the secondary prefix key, to a window as if
	it was pressed.
</p>

<p>
unbind-key [-an] [-T key-table] key
	      (alias: unbind)
	Unbind the command bound to key.  -n and -T are the same as for bind-key.
	If -a is present, all key bindings are removed.
</p>

<p>
OPTIONS
     The appearance and behaviour of tmux may be modified by changing the value of vari‐
     ous options.  There are three types of option: server options, session options and
     window options.
</p>

<p>
The tmux server has a set of global options which do not apply to any particular
window or session.  These are altered with the set-option -s command, or displayed
with the show-options -s command.
</p>

<p>
In addition, each individual session may have a set of session options, and there is
a separate set of global session options.  Sessions which do not have a particular
option configured inherit the value from the global session options.  Session
options are set or unset with the set-option command and may be listed with the
show-options command.  The available server and session options are listed under the
set-option command.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, a set of window options is attached to each window, and there is a set of
global window options from which any unset options are inherited.  Window options
are altered with the set-window-option command and can be listed with the
show-window-options command.  All window options are documented with the
set-window-option command.
</p>

<p>
tmux also supports user options which are prefixed with a ‘@’.  User options may
have any name, so long as they are prefixed with ‘@’, and be set to any string.  For
example:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux setw -q @foo "abc123"
$ tmux showw -v @foo
abc123
</p>

<p>
Commands which set options are as follows:
</p>

<p>
set-option [-aFgoqsuw] [-t target-session | target-window] option value
	      (alias: set)
	Set a window option with -w (equivalent to the set-window-option command), a
	server option with -s, otherwise a session option.  If -g is given, the
	global session or window option is set.  -F expands formats in the option
	value.  The -u flag unsets an option, so a session inherits the option from
	the global options (or with -g, restores a global option to the default).
</p>

<p>
The -o flag prevents setting an option that is already set and the -q flag
suppresses errors about unknown or ambiguous options.
</p>

<p>
With -a, and if the option expects a string or a style, value is appended to
the existing setting.  For example:
</p>

<p>
set -g status-left "foo"
set -ag status-left "bar"
</p>

<p>
Will result in ‘foobar’.  And:
</p>

<p>
set -g status-style "bg=red"
set -ag status-style "fg=blue"
</p>

<p>
Will result in a red background and blue foreground.  Without -a, the result
would be the default background and a blue foreground.
</p>

<p>
Available window options are listed under set-window-option.
</p>

<p>
value depends on the option and may be a number, a string, or a flag (on,
off, or omitted to toggle).
</p>

<p>
Available server options are:
</p>

<p>
buffer-limit number
	Set the number of buffers; as new buffers are added to the top of
	the stack, old ones are removed from the bottom if necessary to
	maintain this maximum length.
</p>

<p>
command-alias[] name=value
	This is an array of custom aliases for commands.  If an unknown com‐
	mand matches name, it is replaced with value.  For example, after:
</p>

<p>
set -s command-alias[100] zoom='resize-pane -Z'
</p>

<p>
Using:
</p>

<p>
zoom -t:.1
</p>

<p>
Is equivalent to:
</p>

<p>
resize-pane -Z -t:.1
</p>

<p>
Note that aliases are expanded when a command is parsed rather than
when it is executed, so binding an alias with bind-key will bind the
expanded form.
</p>

<p>
default-terminal terminal
	Set the default terminal for new windows created in this session -
	the default value of the TERM environment variable.  For tmux to
	work correctly, this must be set to ‘screen’, ‘tmux’ or a derivative
	of them.
</p>

<p>
escape-time time
	Set the time in milliseconds for which tmux waits after an escape is
	input to determine if it is part of a function or meta key
	sequences.  The default is 500 milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
exit-empty [on | off]
	If enabled (the default), the server will exit when there are no
	active sessions.
</p>

<p>
exit-unattached [on | off]
	If enabled, the server will exit when there are no attached clients.
</p>

<p>
focus-events [on | off]
	When enabled, focus events are requested from the terminal if sup‐
	ported and passed through to applications running in tmux.  Attached
	clients should be detached and attached again after changing this
	option.
</p>

<p>
history-file path
	If not empty, a file to which tmux will write command prompt history
	on exit and load it from on start.
</p>

<p>
message-limit number
	Set the number of error or information messages to save in the mes‐
	sage log for each client.  The default is 100.
</p>

<p>
set-clipboard [on | external | off]
	Attempt to set the terminal clipboard content using the xterm(1)
	escape sequence, if there is an Ms entry in the terminfo(5) descrip‐
	tion (see the TERMINFO EXTENSIONS section).
</p>

<p>
If set to on, tmux will both accept the escape sequence to create a
buffer and attempt to set the terminal clipboard.  If set to
external, tmux will attempt to set the terminal clipboard but ignore
attempts by applications to set tmux buffers.  If off, tmux will
neither accept the clipboard escape sequence nor attempt to set the
clipboard.
</p>

<p>
Note that this feature needs to be enabled in xterm(1) by setting
the resource:
</p>

<p>
disallowedWindowOps: 20,21,SetXprop
</p>

<p>
Or changing this property from the xterm(1) interactive menu when
required.
</p>

<p>
terminal-overrides[] string
	Allow terminal descriptions read using terminfo(5) to be overridden.
	Each entry is a colon-separated string made up of a terminal type
	pattern (matched using fnmatch(3)) and a set of name=value entries.
</p>

<p>
For example, to set the ‘clear’ terminfo(5) entry to ‘\e[H\e[2J’ for
all terminal types matching ‘rxvt*’:
</p>

<p>
rxvt*:clear=\e[H\e[2J
</p>

<p>
The terminal entry value is passed through strunvis(3) before inter‐
pretation.
</p>

<p>
Available session options are:
</p>

<p>
activity-action [any | none | current | other]
	Set action on window activity when monitor-activity is on.  any
	means activity in any window linked to a session causes a bell or
	message (depending on visual-activity) in the current window of that
	session, none means all activity is ignored (equivalent to
	monitor-activity being off), current means only activity in windows
	other than the current window are ignored and other means activity
	in the current window is ignored but not those in other windows.
</p>

<p>
assume-paste-time milliseconds
	If keys are entered faster than one in milliseconds, they are
	assumed to have been pasted rather than typed and tmux key bindings
	are not processed.  The default is one millisecond and zero dis‐
	ables.
</p>

<p>
base-index index
	Set the base index from which an unused index should be searched
	when a new window is created.  The default is zero.
</p>

<p>
bell-action [any | none | current | other]
	Set action on a bell in a window when monitor-bell is on.  The val‐
	ues are the same as those for activity-action.
</p>

<p>
default-command shell-command
	Set the command used for new windows (if not specified when the win‐
	dow is created) to shell-command, which may be any sh(1) command.
	The default is an empty string, which instructs tmux to create a
	login shell using the value of the default-shell option.
</p>

<p>
default-shell path
	Specify the default shell.  This is used as the login shell for new
	windows when the default-command option is set to empty, and must be
	the full path of the executable.  When started tmux tries to set a
	default value from the first suitable of the SHELL environment vari‐
	able, the shell returned by getpwuid(3), or /bin/sh.  This option
	should be configured when tmux is used as a login shell.
</p>

<p>
destroy-unattached [on | off]
	If enabled and the session is no longer attached to any clients, it
	is destroyed.
</p>

<p>
detach-on-destroy [on | off]
	If on (the default), the client is detached when the session it is
	attached to is destroyed.  If off, the client is switched to the
	most recently active of the remaining sessions.
</p>

<p>
display-panes-active-colour colour
	Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the indica‐
	tor for the active pane.
</p>

<p>
display-panes-colour colour
	Set the colour used by the display-panes command to show the indica‐
	tors for inactive panes.
</p>

<p>
display-panes-time time
	Set the time in milliseconds for which the indicators shown by the
	display-panes command appear.
</p>

<p>
display-time time
	Set the amount of time for which status line messages and other on-
	screen indicators are displayed.  If set to 0, messages and indica‐
	tors are displayed until a key is pressed.  time is in milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
history-limit lines
	Set the maximum number of lines held in window history.  This set‐
	ting applies only to new windows - existing window histories are not
	resized and retain the limit at the point they were created.
</p>

<p>
key-table key-table
	Set the default key table to key-table instead of root.
</p>

<p>
lock-after-time number
	Lock the session (like the lock-session command) after number sec‐
	onds of inactivity.  The default is not to lock (set to 0).
</p>

<p>
lock-command shell-command
	Command to run when locking each client.  The default is to run
	lock(1) with -np.
</p>

<p>
message-command-style style
	Set status line message command style, where style is a comma-sepa‐
	rated list of characteristics to be specified.
</p>

<p>
These may be ‘bg=colour’ to set the background colour, ‘fg=colour’
to set the foreground colour, and a list of attributes as specified
below.
</p>

<p>
The colour is one of: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta,
cyan, white, aixterm bright variants (if supported: brightred,
brightgreen, and so on), colour0 to colour255 from the 256-colour
set, default, or a hexadecimal RGB string such as ‘#ffffff’, which
chooses the closest match from the default 256-colour set.
</p>

<p>
The attributes is either none or a comma-delimited list of one or
more of: bright (or bold), dim, underscore, blink, reverse, hidden,
italics, or strikethrough to turn an attribute on, or an attribute
prefixed with ‘no’ to turn one off.
</p>

<p>
Examples are:
</p>

<p>
fg=yellow,bold,underscore,blink
bg=black,fg=default,noreverse
</p>

<p>
With the -a flag to the set-option command the new style is added
otherwise the existing style is replaced.
</p>

<p>
message-style style
	Set status line message style.  For how to specify style, see the
	message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
mouse [on | off]
	If on, tmux captures the mouse and allows mouse events to be bound
	as key bindings.  See the MOUSE SUPPORT section for details.
</p>

<p>
prefix key
	Set the key accepted as a prefix key.  In addition to the standard
	keys described under KEY BINDINGS, prefix can be set to the special
	key ‘None’ to set no prefix.
</p>

<p>
prefix2 key
	Set a secondary key accepted as a prefix key.  Like prefix, prefix2
	can be set to ‘None’.
</p>

<p>
renumber-windows [on | off]
	If on, when a window is closed in a session, automatically renumber
	the other windows in numerical order.  This respects the base-index
	option if it has been set.  If off, do not renumber the windows.
</p>

<p>
repeat-time time
	Allow multiple commands to be entered without pressing the prefix-
	key again in the specified time milliseconds (the default is 500).
	Whether a key repeats may be set when it is bound using the -r flag
	to bind-key.  Repeat is enabled for the default keys bound to the
	resize-pane command.
</p>

<p>
set-titles [on | off]
	Attempt to set the client terminal title using the tsl and fsl
	terminfo(5) entries if they exist.  tmux automatically sets these to
	the \e]0;&#x2026;\007 sequence if the terminal appears to be xterm(1).
	This option is off by default.
</p>

<p>
set-titles-string string
	String used to set the window title if set-titles is on.  Formats
	are expanded, see the FORMATS section.
</p>

<p>
silence-action [any | none | current | other]

	Set the position of the window list component of the status line:
	left, centre or right justified.
</p>

<p>
status-keys [vi | emacs]
	Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in the status line, for example
	at the command prompt.  The default is emacs, unless the VISUAL or
	EDITOR environment variables are set and contain the string ‘vi’.
</p>

<p>
status-left string
	Display string (by default the session name) to the left of the sta‐
	tus line.  string will be passed through strftime(3) and formats
	(see FORMATS) will be expanded.  It may also contain the special
	character sequence #[] to change the colour or attributes, for exam‐
	ple ‘#[fg=red,bright]’ to set a bright red foreground.  See the
	message-command-style option for a description of colours and
	attributes.
</p>

<p>
For details on how the names and titles can be set see the NAMES AND
TITLES section.
</p>

<p>
Examples are:
</p>

<p>

	and character pairs are replaced.
</p>

<p>
status-right-length length
	Set the maximum length of the right component of the status line.
	The default is 40.
</p>

<p>
status-right-style style
	Set the style of the right part of the status line.  For how to
	specify style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
status-style style
	Set status line style.  For how to specify style, see the
	message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
update-environment[] variable
	Set list of environment variables to be copied into the session
	environment when a new session is created or an existing session is
	attached.  Any variables that do not exist in the source environment
	are set to be removed from the session environment (as if -r was
	given to the set-environment command).
</p>

<p>
user-keys[] key
	Set list of user-defined key escape sequences.  Each item is associ‐
	ated with a key named ‘User0’, ‘User1’, and so on.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<p>
set -s user-keys[0] "\e[5;30012~"
bind User0 resize-pane -L 3
</p>

<p>
visual-activity [on | off | both]
	If on, display a message instead of sending a bell when activity
	occurs in a window for which the monitor-activity window option is
	enabled.  If set to both, a bell and a message are produced.
</p>

<p>
visual-bell [on | off | both]
	If on, a message is shown on a bell in a window for which the
	monitor-bell window option is enabled instead of it being passed
	through to the terminal (which normally makes a sound).  If set to
	both, a bell and a message are produced.  Also see the bell-action
	option.
</p>

<p>
visual-silence [on | off | both]
	If monitor-silence is enabled, prints a message after the interval
	has expired on a given window instead of sending a bell.  If set to
	both, a bell and a message are produced.
</p>

<p>
word-separators string
	Sets the session's conception of what characters are considered word
	separators, for the purposes of the next and previous word commands
	in copy mode.  The default is ‘ -_@’.
</p>

<p>
set-window-option [-aFgoqu] [-t target-window] option value
	      (alias: setw)
	Set a window option.  The -a, -F, -g, -o, -q and -u flags work similarly to
	the set-option command.
</p>

<p>
Supported window options are:
</p>

<p>
aggressive-resize [on | off]
	Aggressively resize the chosen window.  This means that tmux will
	resize the window to the size of the smallest session for which it
	is the current window, rather than the smallest session to which it
	is attached.  The window may resize when the current window is
	changed on another sessions; this option is good for full-screen
	programs which support SIGWINCH and poor for interactive programs
	such as shells.
</p>

<p>
allow-rename [on | off]
	Allow programs to change the window name using a terminal escape
	sequence (\ek&#x2026;\e\\).  The default is off.
</p>

<p>
alternate-screen [on | off]
	This option configures whether programs running inside tmux may use
	the terminal alternate screen feature, which allows the smcup and
	rmcup terminfo(5) capabilities.  The alternate screen feature pre‐
	serves the contents of the window when an interactive application
	starts and restores it on exit, so that any output visible before
	the application starts reappears unchanged after it exits.  The
	default is on.
</p>

<p>
automatic-rename [on | off]
	Control automatic window renaming.  When this setting is enabled,
	tmux will rename the window automatically using the format specified
	by automatic-rename-format.  This flag is automatically disabled for
	an individual window when a name is specified at creation with
	new-window or new-session, or later with rename-window, or with a
	terminal escape sequence.  It may be switched off globally with:
</p>

<p>
set-window-option -g automatic-rename off
</p>

<p>
automatic-rename-format format
	The format (see FORMATS) used when the automatic-rename option is
	enabled.
</p>

<p>
clock-mode-colour colour
	Set clock colour.
</p>

<p>
clock-mode-style [12 | 24]
	Set clock hour format.
</p>

<p>
force-height height
force-width width
	Prevent tmux from resizing a window to greater than width or height.
	A value of zero restores the default unlimited setting.
</p>

<p>
main-pane-height height
main-pane-width width
	Set the width or height of the main (left or top) pane in the
	main-horizontal or main-vertical layouts.
</p>

<p>
mode-keys [vi | emacs]
	Use vi or emacs-style key bindings in copy mode.  The default is
	emacs, unless VISUAL or EDITOR contains ‘vi’.
</p>

<p>
mode-style style
	Set window modes style.  For how to specify style, see the
	message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
monitor-activity [on | off]
	Monitor for activity in the window.  Windows with activity are high‐
	lighted in the status line.
</p>

<p>
monitor-bell [on | off]
	Monitor for a bell in the window.  Windows with a bell are high‐
	lighted in the status line.
</p>

<p>
monitor-silence [interval]
	Monitor for silence (no activity) in the window within interval sec‐
	onds.  Windows that have been silent for the interval are high‐
	lighted in the status line.  An interval of zero disables the moni‐
	toring.
</p>

<p>
other-pane-height height
	Set the height of the other panes (not the main pane) in the
	main-horizontal layout.  If this option is set to 0 (the default),
	it will have no effect.  If both the main-pane-height and
	other-pane-height options are set, the main pane will grow taller to
	make the other panes the specified height, but will never shrink to
	do so.
</p>

<p>
other-pane-width width
	Like other-pane-height, but set the width of other panes in the
	main-vertical layout.
</p>

<p>
pane-active-border-style style
	Set the pane border style for the currently active pane.  For how to
	specify style, see the message-command-style option.  Attributes are
	ignored.
</p>

<p>

	Like base-index, but set the starting index for pane numbers.
</p>

<p>
pane-border-format format
	Set the text shown in pane border status lines.
</p>

<p>
pane-border-status [off | top | bottom]
	Turn pane border status lines off or set their position.
</p>

<p>
pane-border-style style
	Set the pane border style for panes aside from the active pane.  For
	how to specify style, see the message-command-style option.
	Attributes are ignored.
</p>

<p>
remain-on-exit [on | off]
	A window with this flag set is not destroyed when the program run‐
	ning in it exits.  The window may be reactivated with the
	respawn-window command.
</p>

<p>
synchronize-panes [on | off]
	Duplicate input to any pane to all other panes in the same window
	(only for panes that are not in any special mode).
</p>

<p>
window-active-style style
	Set the style for the window's active pane.  For how to specify
	style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
window-status-activity-style style
	Set status line style for windows with an activity alert.  For how
	to specify style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
window-status-bell-style style
	Set status line style for windows with a bell alert.  For how to
	specify style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
window-status-current-format string
	Like window-status-format, but is the format used when the window is
	the current window.
</p>

<p>
window-status-current-style style
	Set status line style for the currently active window.  For how to
	specify style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
window-status-format string
	Set the format in which the window is displayed in the status line
	window list.  See the status-left option for details of special
	character sequences available.  The default is ‘#I:#W#F’.
</p>

<p>
window-status-last-style style
	Set status line style for the last active window.  For how to spec‐
	ify style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
window-status-separator string
	Sets the separator drawn between windows in the status line.  The
	default is a single space character.
</p>

<p>
window-status-style style
	Set status line style for a single window.  For how to specify
	style, see the message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
window-style style
	Set the default window style.  For how to specify style, see the
	message-command-style option.
</p>

<p>
wrap-search [on | off]
	If this option is set, searches will wrap around the end of the pane
	contents.  The default is on.
</p>

<p>
xterm-keys [on | off]
	If this option is set, tmux will generate xterm(1) -style function
	key sequences; these have a number included to indicate modifiers
	such as Shift, Alt or Ctrl.
</p>

<p>
show-options [-gqsvw] [-t target-session | target-window] [option]
	      (alias: show)
	Show the window options (or a single window option if given) with -w (equiv‐
	alent to show-window-options), the server options with -s, otherwise the
	session options for target session.  Global session or window options are
	listed if -g is used.  -v shows only the option value, not the name.  If -q
	is set, no error will be returned if option is unset.
</p>

<p>
show-window-options [-gv] [-t target-window] [option]
	      (alias: showw)
	List the window options or a single option for target-window, or the global
	window options if -g is used.  -v shows only the option value, not the name.
</p>

<p>
HOOKS
     tmux allows commands to run on various triggers, called hooks.  Most tmux commands
     have an after hook and there are a number of hooks not associated with commands.
</p>

<p>
A command's after hook is run after it completes, except when the command is run as
part of a hook itself.  They are named with an ‘after-’ prefix.  For example, the
following command adds a hook to select the even-vertical layout after every
split-window:
</p>

<p>
set-hook after-split-window "selectl even-vertical"
</p>

<p>
All the notifications listed in the CONTROL MODE section are hooks (without any
arguments), except %exit.  The following additional hooks are available:
</p>

<p>
alert-activity          Run when a window has activity.  See monitor-activity.
</p>

<p>
alert-bell              Run when a window has received a bell.  See monitor-bell.
</p>

<p>

Hooks are managed with these commands:
</p>

<p>
set-hook [-gu] [-t target-session] hook-name command
	Sets (or with -u unsets) hook hook-name to command.  If -g is given,
	hook-name is added to the global list of hooks, otherwise it is added to the
	session hooks (for target-session with -t).  Like options, session hooks
	inherit from the global ones.
</p>

<p>
show-hooks [-g] [-t target-session]
	Shows the global list of hooks with -g, otherwise the session hooks.
</p>

<p>
MOUSE SUPPORT
     If the mouse option is on (the default is off), tmux allows mouse events to be bound
     as keys.  The name of each key is made up of a mouse event (such as ‘MouseUp1’) and
     a location suffix (one of ‘Pane’ for the contents of a pane, ‘Border’ for a pane
     border or ‘Status’ for the status line).  The following mouse events are available:
</p>

<p>
WheelUp       WheelDown
MouseDown1    MouseUp1      MouseDrag1   MouseDragEnd1
MouseDown2    MouseUp2      MouseDrag2   MouseDragEnd2
MouseDown3    MouseUp3      MouseDrag3   MouseDragEnd3
DoubleClick1  DoubleClick2  DoubleClick3
TripleClick1  TripleClick2  TripleClick3
</p>

<p>
Each should be suffixed with a location, for example ‘MouseDown1Status’.
</p>

<p>
The special token ‘{mouse}’ or ‘=’ may be used as target-window or target-pane in
commands bound to mouse key bindings.  It resolves to the window or pane over which
the mouse event took place (for example, the window in the status line over which
button 1 was released for a ‘MouseUp1Status’ binding, or the pane over which the
wheel was scrolled for a ‘WheelDownPane’ binding).
</p>

<p>
The send-keys -M flag may be used to forward a mouse event to a pane.
</p>

<p>
The default key bindings allow the mouse to be used to select and resize panes, to
copy text and to change window using the status line.  These take effect if the
mouse option is turned on.
</p>

<p>
FORMATS
     Certain commands accept the -F flag with a format argument.  This is a string which
     controls the output format of the command.  Replacement variables are enclosed in
     ‘#{’ and ‘}’, for example ‘#{session_name}’.  The possible variables are listed in
     the table below, or the name of a tmux option may be used for an option's value.
     Some variables have a shorter alias such as ‘#S’, and ‘##’ is replaced by a single
     ‘#’.
</p>

<p>
Conditionals are available by prefixing with ‘?’ and separating two alternatives
with a comma; if the specified variable exists and is not zero, the first alterna‐
tive is chosen, otherwise the second is used.  For example
‘#{?session_attached,attached,not attached}’ will include the string ‘attached’ if
the session is attached and the string ‘not attached’ if it is unattached, or
‘#{?automatic-rename,yes,no}’ will include ‘yes’ if automatic-rename is enabled, or
‘no’ if not.
</p>

<p>
Comparisons may be expressed by prefixing two comma-separated alternatives by ‘==’
or ‘!=’ and a colon.  For example ‘#{==:#{host},myhost}’ will be replaced by ‘1’ if
running on ‘myhost’, otherwise by ‘0’.  An ‘m’ specifies an fnmatch(3) comparison
where the first argument is the pattern and the second the string to compare, for
example ‘#{m:*foo*,#{host}}’.  ‘||’ and ‘&amp;&amp;’ evaluate to true if either or both of
two comma-separated alternatives are true, for example
‘#{||,#{pane_in_mode},#{alternate_on}}’.  A ‘C’ performs a search for an fnmatch(3)
pattern in the pane content and evaluates to zero if not found, or a line number if
found.
</p>

<p>
A limit may be placed on the length of the resultant string by prefixing it by an
‘=’, a number and a colon.  Positive numbers count from the start of the string and
negative from the end, so ‘#{<code>5:pane_title}’ will include at most the first 5 char‐
     acters of the pane title, or ‘#{</code>-5:pane_title}’ the last 5 characters.  Prefixing a
time variable with ‘t:’ will convert it to a string, so if ‘#{window_activity}’
gives ‘1445765102’, ‘#{t:window_activity}’ gives ‘Sun Oct 25 09:25:02 2015’.  The
‘b:’ and ‘d:’ prefixes are basename(3) and dirname(3) of the variable respectively.
A prefix of the form ‘s/foo/bar/:’ will substitute ‘foo’ with ‘bar’ throughout.
</p>

<p>
In addition, the first line of a shell command's output may be inserted using ‘#()’.
For example, ‘#(uptime)’ will insert the system's uptime.  When constructing for‐
mats, tmux does not wait for ‘#()’ commands to finish; instead, the previous result
from running the same command is used, or a placeholder if the command has not been
run before.  If the command hasn't exited, the most recent line of output will be
used, but the status line will not be updated more than once a second.  Commands are
executed with the tmux global environment set (see the ENVIRONMENT section).
</p>

<p>
NAMES AND TITLES
     tmux distinguishes between names and titles.  Windows and sessions have names, which
     may be used to specify them in targets and are displayed in the status line and var‐
     ious lists: the name is the tmux identifier for a window or session.  Only panes
     have titles.  A pane's title is typically set by the program running inside the pane
     using an escape sequence (like it would set the xterm(1) window title in X(7)).
     Windows themselves do not have titles - a window's title is the title of its active
     pane.  tmux itself may set the title of the terminal in which the client is running,
     see the set-titles option.
</p>

<p>
A session's name is set with the new-session and rename-session commands.  A win‐
dow's name is set with one of:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A command argument (such as -n for new-window or new-session).</li>

<li><p>
An escape sequence:
</p>

<p>
$ printf '\033kWINDOW_NAME\033\\'
</p></li>

<li>Automatic renaming, which sets the name to the active command in the win‐
dow's active pane.  See the automatic-rename option.</li>
</ol>

<p>
When a pane is first created, its title is the hostname.  A pane's title can be set
via the OSC title setting sequence, for example:
</p>

<p>
$ printf '\033]2;My Title\033\\'
</p>

<p>
It can also be modified with the select-pane -T command.
</p>

<p>
ENVIRONMENT
     When the server is started, tmux copies the environment into the global environment;
     in addition, each session has a session environment.  When a window is created, the
     session and global environments are merged.  If a variable exists in both, the value
     from the session environment is used.  The result is the initial environment passed
     to the new process.
</p>

<p>
The update-environment session option may be used to update the session environment
from the client when a new session is created or an old reattached.  tmux also ini‐
tialises the TMUX variable with some internal information to allow commands to be
executed from inside, and the TERM variable with the correct terminal setting of
‘screen’.
</p>

<p>
Commands to alter and view the environment are:
</p>

<p>
set-environment [-gru] [-t target-session] name [value]
	      (alias: setenv)
	Set or unset an environment variable.  If -g is used, the change is made in
	the global environment; otherwise, it is applied to the session environment
	for target-session.  The -u flag unsets a variable.  -r indicates the vari‐
	able is to be removed from the environment before starting a new process.
</p>

<p>
show-environment [-gs] [-t target-session] [variable]
	      (alias: showenv)
	Display the environment for target-session or the global environment with
	-g.  If variable is omitted, all variables are shown.  Variables removed
	from the environment are prefixed with ‘-’.  If -s is used, the output is
	formatted as a set of Bourne shell commands.
</p>

<p>
STATUS LINE
     tmux includes an optional status line which is displayed in the bottom line of each
     terminal.  By default, the status line is enabled (it may be disabled with the
     status session option) and contains, from left-to-right: the name of the current
     session in square brackets; the window list; the title of the active pane in double
     quotes; and the time and date.
</p>

<p>
The status line is made of three parts: configurable left and right sections (which
may contain dynamic content such as the time or output from a shell command, see the
status-left, status-left-length, status-right, and status-right-length options
below), and a central window list.  By default, the window list shows the index,
name and (if any) flag of the windows present in the current session in ascending
numerical order.  It may be customised with the window-status-format and
window-status-current-format options.  The flag is one of the following symbols
appended to the window name:
</p>

<p>
Symbol    Meaning
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Denotes the current window.</li>
<li>Marks the last window (previously selected).</li>
</ul>

<p>
!         Window bells are monitored and a bell has occurred in the window.
~         The window has been silent for the monitor-silence interval.
M         The window contains the marked pane.
Z         The window's active pane is zoomed.
</p>

<p>
The # symbol relates to the monitor-activity window option.  The window name is
printed in inverted colours if an alert (bell, activity or silence) is present.
</p>

<p>
The colour and attributes of the status line may be configured, the entire status
line using the status-style session option and individual windows using the
window-status-style window option.
</p>

<p>
The status line is automatically refreshed at interval if it has changed, the inter‐
val may be controlled with the status-interval session option.
</p>

<p>
Commands related to the status line are as follows:
</p>

<p>
command-prompt [-1i] [-I inputs] [-p prompts] [-t target-client] [template]
	Open the command prompt in a client.  This may be used from inside tmux to
	execute commands interactively.
</p>

<p>
If template is specified, it is used as the command.  If present, -I is a
comma-separated list of the initial text for each prompt.  If -p is given,
prompts is a comma-separated list of prompts which are displayed in order;
otherwise a single prompt is displayed, constructed from template if it is
present, or ‘:’ if not.
</p>

<p>
Before the command is executed, the first occurrence of the string ‘%%’ and
all occurrences of ‘%1’ are replaced by the response to the first prompt,
all ‘%2’ are replaced with the response to the second prompt, and so on for
further prompts.  Up to nine prompt responses may be replaced (‘%1’ to
‘%9’).  ‘%%%’ is like ‘%%’ but any quotation marks are escaped.
</p>

<p>
-1 makes the prompt only accept one key press, in this case the resulting
input is a single character.  -i executes the command every time the prompt
input changes instead of when the user exits the command prompt.
</p>

<p>
The following keys have a special meaning in the command prompt, depending
on the value of the status-keys option:
</p>

<p>
Function                             vi        emacs

Move cursor right                    l         Right
Move cursor to end                   $         C-e
Move cursor to next word             w         M-f
Move cursor to previous word         b         M-b
Move cursor to start                 0         C-a
Transpose characters                           C-t
</p>

<p>
confirm-before [-p prompt] [-t target-client] command
	      (alias: confirm)
	Ask for confirmation before executing command.  If -p is given, prompt is
	the prompt to display; otherwise a prompt is constructed from command.  It
	may contain the special character sequences supported by the status-left
	option.
</p>

<p>
This command works only from inside tmux.
</p>

<p>
display-message [-p] [-c target-client] [-t target-pane] [message]
	      (alias: display)
	Display a message.  If -p is given, the output is printed to stdout, other‐
	wise it is displayed in the target-client status line.  The format of
	message is described in the FORMATS section; information is taken from
	target-pane if -t is given, otherwise the active pane for the session
	attached to target-client.
</p>

<p>
BUFFERS
     tmux maintains a set of named paste buffers.  Each buffer may be either explicitly
     or automatically named.  Explicitly named buffers are named when created with the
     set-buffer or load-buffer commands, or by renaming an automatically named buffer
     with set-buffer -n.  Automatically named buffers are given a name such as
     ‘buffer0001’, ‘buffer0002’ and so on.  When the buffer-limit option is reached, the
     oldest automatically named buffer is deleted.  Explicitly named buffers are not sub‐
     ject to buffer-limit and may be deleted with delete-buffer command.
</p>

<p>
Buffers may be added using copy-mode or the set-buffer and load-buffer commands, and
pasted into a window using the paste-buffer command.  If a buffer command is used
and no buffer is specified, the most recently added automatically named buffer is
assumed.
</p>

<p>
A configurable history buffer is also maintained for each window.  By default, up to
2000 lines are kept; this can be altered with the history-limit option (see the
set-option command above).
</p>

<p>
The buffer commands are as follows:
</p>

<p>
choose-buffer [-NZ] [-F format] [-f filter] [-O sort-order] [-t target-pane]
	[template]
	Put a pane into buffer mode, where a buffer may be chosen interactively from
	a list.  -Z zooms the pane.  The following keys may be used in buffer mode:
</p>

<p>
Key    Function
Enter  Paste selected buffer
Up     Select previous buffer
Down   Select next buffer
C-s    Search by name or content
n      Repeat last search
t      Toggle if buffer is tagged
T      Tag no buffers
C-t    Tag all buffers
p      Paste selected buffer
P      Paste tagged buffers
d      Delete selected buffer
D      Delete tagged buffers
f      Enter a format to filter items
O      Change sort order
v      Toggle preview
q      Exit mode
</p>

<p>
After a buffer is chosen, ‘%%’ is replaced by the buffer name in template
and the result executed as a command.  If template is not given, "paste-buf‐
fer -b '%%'" is used.
</p>

<p>
-O specifies the initial sort order: one of ‘time’, ‘name’ or ‘size’.  -f
specifies an initial filter: the filter is a format - if it evaluates to
zero, the item in the list is not shown, otherwise it is shown.  If a filter
would lead to an empty list, it is ignored.  -F specifies the format for
each item in the list.  -N starts without the preview.  This command works
only if at least one client is attached.
</p>

<p>
clear-history [-t target-pane]
	      (alias: clearhist)
	Remove and free the history for the specified pane.
</p>

<p>
delete-buffer [-b buffer-name]
	      (alias: deleteb)
	Delete the buffer named buffer-name, or the most recently added automati‐
	cally named buffer if not specified.
</p>

<p>
list-buffers [-F format]
	      (alias: lsb)
	List the global buffers.  For the meaning of the -F flag, see the FORMATS
	section.
</p>

<p>
load-buffer [-b buffer-name] path
	      (alias: loadb)
	Load the contents of the specified paste buffer from path.
</p>

<p>
paste-buffer [-dpr] [-b buffer-name] [-s separator] [-t target-pane]
	      (alias: pasteb)
	Insert the contents of a paste buffer into the specified pane.  If not spec‐
	ified, paste into the current one.  With -d, also delete the paste buffer.
	When output, any linefeed (LF) characters in the paste buffer are replaced
	with a separator, by default carriage return (CR).  A custom separator may
	be specified using the -s flag.  The -r flag means to do no replacement
	(equivalent to a separator of LF).  If -p is specified, paste bracket con‐
	trol codes are inserted around the buffer if the application has requested
	bracketed paste mode.
</p>

<p>
save-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] path
	      (alias: saveb)
	Save the contents of the specified paste buffer to path.  The -a option
	appends to rather than overwriting the file.
</p>

<p>
set-buffer [-a] [-b buffer-name] [-n new-buffer-name] data
	      (alias: setb)
	Set the contents of the specified buffer to data.  The -a option appends to
	rather than overwriting the buffer.  The -n option renames the buffer to
	new-buffer-name.
</p>

<p>
show-buffer [-b buffer-name]
	      (alias: showb)
	Display the contents of the specified buffer.
</p>

<p>
MISCELLANEOUS
     Miscellaneous commands are as follows:
</p>

<p>
clock-mode [-t target-pane]
	Display a large clock.
</p>

<p>
if-shell [-bF] [-t target-pane] shell-command command [command]
	      (alias: if)
	Execute the first command if shell-command returns success or the second
	command otherwise.  Before being executed, shell-command is expanded using
	the rules specified in the FORMATS section, including those relevant to
	target-pane.  With -b, shell-command is run in the background.
</p>

<p>
If -F is given, shell-command is not executed but considered success if nei‐
ther empty nor zero (after formats are expanded).
</p>

<p>
lock-server
	      (alias: lock)
	Lock each client individually by running the command specified by the
	lock-command option.
</p>

<p>
run-shell [-b] [-t target-pane] shell-command
	      (alias: run)
	Execute shell-command in the background without creating a window.  Before
	being executed, shell-command is expanded using the rules specified in the
	FORMATS section.  With -b, the command is run in the background.  After it
	finishes, any output to stdout is displayed in copy mode (in the pane speci‐
	fied by -t or the current pane if omitted).  If the command doesn't return
	success, the exit status is also displayed.
</p>

<p>
wait-for [-L | -S | -U] channel
	      (alias: wait)
	When used without options, prevents the client from exiting until woken
	using wait-for -S with the same channel.  When -L is used, the channel is
	locked and any clients that try to lock the same channel are made to wait
	until the channel is unlocked with wait-for -U.  This command only works
	from outside tmux.
</p>

<p>
TERMINFO EXTENSIONS
     tmux understands some unofficial extensions to terminfo(5):
</p>

<p>
Cs, Cr  Set the cursor colour.  The first takes a single string argument and is used
	to set the colour; the second takes no arguments and restores the default
	cursor colour.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used to change the
	cursor colour from inside tmux:
</p>

<p>
$ printf '\033]12;red\033\\'
</p>

<p>
Ss, Se  Set or reset the cursor style.  If set, a sequence such as this may be used
	to change the cursor to an underline:
</p>

<p>
$ printf '\033[4 q'
</p>

<p>
If Se is not set, Ss with argument 0 will be used to reset the cursor style
instead.
</p>

<p>
Tc      Indicate that the terminal supports the ‘direct colour’ RGB escape sequence
	(for example, \e[38;2;255;255;255m).
</p>

<p>
If supported, this is used for the OSC initialize colour escape sequence
(which may be enabled by adding the ‘initc’ and ‘ccc’ capabilities to the
tmux terminfo(5) entry).
</p>

<p>
Ms      Store the current buffer in the host terminal's selection (clipboard).  See
	the set-clipboard option above and the xterm(1) man page.
</p>

<p>
CONTROL MODE
     tmux offers a textual interface called control mode.  This allows applications to
     communicate with tmux using a simple text-only protocol.
</p>

<p>
In control mode, a client sends tmux commands or command sequences terminated by
newlines on standard input.  Each command will produce one block of output on stan‐
dard output.  An output block consists of a %begin line followed by the output
(which may be empty).  The output block ends with a %end or %error.  %begin and
matching %end or %error have two arguments: an integer time (as seconds from epoch)
and command number.  For example:
</p>

<p>
%begin 1363006971 2
0: ksh* (1 panes) [80x24] [layout b25f,80x24,0,0,2] @2 (active)
%end 1363006971 2
</p>

<p>
The refresh-client -C command may be used to set the size of a client in control
mode.
</p>

<p>
In control mode, tmux outputs notifications.  A notification will never occur inside
an output block.
</p>

<p>
The following notifications are defined:
</p>

<p>
%client-session-changed client session-id name
	The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named
	name.
</p>

<p>
%exit [reason]
	The tmux client is exiting immediately, either because it is not attached to
	any session or an error occurred.  If present, reason describes why the
	client exited.
</p>

<p>
%layout-change window-id window-layout window-visible-layout window-flags
	The layout of a window with ID window-id changed.  The new layout is
	window-layout.  The window's visible layout is window-visible-layout and the
	window flags are window-flags.
</p>

<p>
%output pane-id value
	A window pane produced output.  value escapes non-printable characters and
	backslash as octal \xxx.
</p>

<p>
%pane-mode-changed pane-id
	The pane with ID pane-id has changed mode.
</p>

<p>
%session-changed session-id name
	The client is now attached to the session with ID session-id, which is named
	name.
</p>

<p>
%session-renamed name
	The current session was renamed to name.
</p>

<p>
%session-window-changed session-id window-id
	The session with ID session-id changed its active window to the window with
	ID window-id.
</p>

<p>
%sessions-changed
	A session was created or destroyed.
</p>

<p>
%unlinked-window-add window-id
	The window with ID window-id was created but is not linked to the current
	session.
</p>

<p>
%window-add window-id
	The window with ID window-id was linked to the current session.
</p>

<p>
%window-close window-id
	The window with ID window-id closed.
</p>

<p>
%window-pane-changed window-id pane-id
	The active pane in the window with ID window-id changed to the pane with ID
	pane-id.
</p>

<p>
%window-renamed window-id name
	The window with ID window-id was renamed to name.
</p>

<p>
FILES
     ~/.tmux.conf       Default tmux configuration file.
     /etc/tmux.conf     System-wide configuration file.
</p>

<p>
EXAMPLES
     To create a new tmux session running vi(1):
</p>

<p>
$ tmux new-session vi
</p>

<p>
Most commands have a shorter form, known as an alias.  For new-session, this is new:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux new vi
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, the shortest unambiguous form of a command is accepted.  If there are
several options, they are listed:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux n
ambiguous command: n, could be: new-session, new-window, next-window
</p>

<p>
Within an active session, a new window may be created by typing ‘C-b c’ (Ctrl fol‐
lowed by the ‘b’ key followed by the ‘c’ key).
</p>

<p>
Windows may be navigated with: ‘C-b 0’ (to select window 0), ‘C-b 1’ (to select win‐
dow 1), and so on; ‘C-b n’ to select the next window; and ‘C-b p’ to select the pre‐
vious window.
</p>

<p>
A session may be detached using ‘C-b d’ (or by an external event such as ssh(1) dis‐
connection) and reattached with:
</p>

<p>
$ tmux attach-session
</p>

<p>
Typing ‘C-b ?’ lists the current key bindings in the current window; up and down may
be used to navigate the list or ‘q’ to exit from it.
</p>

<p>
Commands to be run when the tmux server is started may be placed in the ~/.tmux.conf
configuration file.  Common examples include:
</p>

<p>
Changing the default prefix key:
</p>

<p>
set-option -g prefix C-a
unbind-key C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix
</p>

<p>
Turning the status line off, or changing its colour:
</p>

<p>
set-option -g status off
set-option -g status-style bg=blue
</p>

<p>
Setting other options, such as the default command, or locking after 30 minutes of
inactivity:
</p>

<p>
set-option -g default-command "exec /bin/ksh"
set-option -g lock-after-time 1800
</p>

<p>
Creating new key bindings:
</p>

<p>
bind-key b set-option status
bind-key / command-prompt "split-window 'exec man %%'"
bind-key S command-prompt "new-window -n %1 'ssh %1'"
</p>
